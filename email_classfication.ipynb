Moreover, Enron\\'s new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. \\nThe extent of Enron\\'s dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn\\'t be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors\\' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don\\'t show up on its balance sheet. If that\\'s so, the company\\'s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. \\nEnron didn\\'t immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron\\'s board members couldn\\'t immediately be reached for comment. \\nTen Long Days\\nEnron\\'s previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow\\'s role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. \\nThe turmoil that resulted in Fastow\\'s departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.\\nEnron\\'s End Run?   \\nNew financial chief\\'s involvement in Enron business partners\\nEnron-Related Entity\\tCreation DateMcMahon Involved?\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nECT Strategic Value Corp.4/18/1985\\tYes\\t\\t\\nJILP-LP Inc.\\t9/27/1995\\tYes\\t\\nECT Investments Inc.\\t3/1/1996\\tYes\\t\\nKenobe Inc.\\t11/8/1996\\tYes\\t\\nEnserco LLC\\t1/7/1997\\tYes\\t\\nObi-1 Holdings LLC\\t1/7/1997\\tYes\\t\\nOilfield Business Investments1/7/1997\\tYes\\t\\t\\nHGK Enterprises LP Inc.\\t7/29/1997\\tYes\\t\\nECT Eocene Enterprises III Inc.2/20/1998Yes\\t\\t\\t\\nJedi Capital II LLC\\t9/4/1998\\tYes\\t\\nE.C.T.

The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon\\'s participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It\\'s not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. \\nAmong ES Power 3\\'s senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn\\'t commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn\\'t immediately returned. \\nDemands, Demands\\nRating agencies Moody\\'s, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron\\'s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. \\nIf Enron\\'s rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. \\nFriday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron\\'s condition. \\nThis week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the \"market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.\" He added: \"It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets.\" \\nMcMahon reportedly objected to Fastow\\'s role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he\\'s connected to don\\'t do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. \\n\\nUnder The Radar: Enron\\'s Flickering Bulb\\nBy Christopher Edmonds <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>\\nSpecial to TheStreet.com\\n10/26/2001 05:08 PM EDT\\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10003075.html>\\n\\nWhile the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it\\'s clearly flickering. To date, investors aren\\'t sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. \\nWhat\\'s happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could\\'ve been imagined with any number of ne\\'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, \"I never had to worry about Enron\\'s ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe.\" \\nPeter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron\\'s adventures for some time. If you\\'d listened to him earlier this year, you\\'d have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron\\'s partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. \\nThe rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron\\'s current woes. \\nNow, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. \\nThe Company\\'s Challenge\\nBut what does Enron do now? It\\'s very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. \\n\"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,\" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. \"We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\" \\nDietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street\\'s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. \\nStraightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. \\nAlthough Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren\\'t so sure. They\\'re focused on the company\\'s Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. \\nThe divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. \\nThe credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor\\'s and Baa1 from Moody\\'s, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron\\'s debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. \\nFrankly, everything falls on Enron\\'s management team and its ability to reassure investors. \"If Enron\\'s management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dietert says. \"In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron\\'s ability to generate earnings and cash flow.\" \\nIt\\'s time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It\\'s a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. \\nThere\\'s an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron\\'s lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, \"Why? Ask why.\" \\nInvestors are now asking. It\\'s time for Ken Lay to answer. \\nFirst Things First\\nMany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week. Thank you for your concern. My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade. \\nThe choice was easy. I\\'m with him and my family. \\nEnjoy your weekend with family and friends. \\n\\n\\n\\nDJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default\\n2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)\\n\\n   By Kristen McNamara \\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \\n \\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.\\'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its\\ncredit requirement in New England\\'s wholesale power market this month, but the\\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the\\norganization that developed the market\\'s rules said Friday. \\n\\n  The operator of the region\\'s wholesale power market informed Enron Energy\\nServices last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a\\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\\nrisk for expulsion from New England\\'s market. \\n\\n  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that\\ntriggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the\\npast, the market\\'s rulemaker said. \\n\\n  \"I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\\nparticipants\" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, \"and it\\'s never\\nbeen in the news,\" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New\\nEngland Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region\\'s\\nelectricity market. \"My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\\nproportion.\" \\n\\n  News of the Enron unit\\'s default appeared in a trade publication and a major\\nmetropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron\\'s dealings with partnerships headed\\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company\\'s\\nstock and bond prices. \\n\\n  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its\\nbonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem\\nwithin a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. \\n\\n  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region\\'s power market,\\nto notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\\nperson, delaying the company\\'s response, Mahoney said. \\n\\n  \"Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,\" Mahoney said. \\n\\n  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England\\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\\ndefault. \\n\\n  It\\'s rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\\noccasion, Foley and Doot said. \\n\\n  \"I won\\'t say it\\'s commonplace, but I won\\'t say it\\'s unusual for a participant\\nto find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have in fact\\nhappened from time to time.\" \\n\\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\\n\\n\\n\\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\\n2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)\\n\\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\\n\\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.\\'s lawsuit\\nalleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services\\ncould temporarily block the largest software company\\'s high-speed\\nInternet service in some U.S. regions.\\n\\n     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company\\nfrom providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron\\nprovides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in\\nthe 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.\\noperates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.\\n\\n     Enron\\'s lawsuit was filed yesterday.

Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees\\n\\n10/26/2001\\nBusiness Wire\\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\\n\\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle\\'s Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron\\'s retirement and 401(k) plans. \\nThe investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans\\' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.\\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking \"non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,\" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron\\'s CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. \\nIf you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. \\nSeattle\\'s Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.\\n\\n\\nCONTACT: Keller Rohrback L.L.P.

The two bills -- S=\\nB=20\\n5x by state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, and AB 29x by Assemblywoman=20\\nChristine Kehoe, D-San Diego -- together would cost the state $1.2 billion,=\\n=20\\nthough Gov. Gray Davis may reduce that with line-item vetoes should the=20\\nlegislation reach his desk.=20\\nThe dozens of conservation measures include:=20\\n$20 million in rebates or other incentives to encourage Californians to=20\\nreplace inefficient appliances, with priority given to low- and middle-inco=\\nme=20\\nresidents.=20\\nAn outreach program to teach schoolchildren about saving energy.=20\\n$14.5 million for efficient traffic signal lights.=20\\nLawmakers want to give the bills to Davis before next week\\'s scheduled spri=\\nng=20\\nrecess begins late Thursday, but the legislation remains mired in a=20\\ncross-house entanglement over a series of changes that the Assembly pencile=\\nd=20\\ninto SB 5x on Tuesday.=20\\nThe Assembly approved the bill Wednesday on a 74-1 vote, but the Senate=20\\nadjourned without resolving the dispute.=20\\nAssembly leaders said that unless several proposals favorable to farmers we=\\nre=20\\nincluded in the bill, a group of Central Valley lawmakers would have oppose=\\nd=20\\nit.=20\\nOne proposal limits the amount of time interruptible agricultural customers=\\n=20\\ncan lose energy to four hours a day or 20 hours per month. Michael Boccador=\\no=20\\nof the Agriculture Energy Consumers Association said farmers and food=20\\nprocessors are concerned that their perishables would not be able to surviv=\\ne=20\\nbeyond that amount of time.=20\\nThe provision would affect \"interruptible,\" customers, those who volunteer =\\nto=20\\nlose power in emergencies in exchange for lower rates.=20\\nAssemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced, a main proponent of the proposals, sa=\\nid=20\\nthe state\\'s farmers are going to be the most hurt by rolling blackouts and=\\n=20\\nhigh rates this summer and \"are getting ready to leave the state if we don\\'=\\nt=20\\ntake care of the problem.\"=20\\nBut the late change riled Senate leaders. Senate President Pro Tem John=20\\nBurton, D-San Francisco, said it would shift costs from farmers to urban=20\\nresidents and develop special programs for agricultural customers.=20\\n\"I think the ag people were very greedy, and what they gained in this=20\\namendment, they may lose in other stuff,\" Burton said.=20\\nAssemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said he does not support some of the=\\n=20\\namendments but said that they should not prevent the conservation package=\\n=20\\nfrom moving forward.=20\\n\"We\\'re trying to solve a problem,\" he said. \"In my view, we cannot let the=\\n=20\\nperfect be the enemy of the good.\"=20\\nDavis met privately with Assembly Republicans on Wednesday for two hours an=\\nd=20\\nemerged saying he would talk about rate increases during tonight\\'s=20\\nfive-minute televised speech.=20\\nRepublicans said they discussed proposals that would boost energy supply in=\\n=20\\nthe state and one to allow businesses to contract on their own for energy,=\\n=20\\nwhich won the Democratic governor\\'s support.=20\\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides, meanwhile, said he has lined up commitments=\\n=20\\nfor $4.1 billion in loans to keep the state going for the next few months=\\n=20\\nuntil the sale of bonds to buy electricity. He hopes to get a total of $5=\\n=20\\nbillion to $6 billion in bridge loans. The money will be used to repay the=\\n=20\\nstate\\'s general fund for what it has spent on power so far.=20\\nThe loans, in turn, would be paid back with money from the bond sales. But=\\n=20\\nAngelides warned that, before the bonds can be sold, he needs more=20\\ninformation from Davis about what\\'s being spent on power.=20\\n\"We will be selling the bonds in the public marketplace and so information=\\n=20\\nmust be made publicly available,\" he said.=20\\nThe treasurer, who like Davis is a Democrat, said he wants to see the=20\\ninformation and the administration\\'s long-term plan before he supports=20\\nselling bonds in excess of $10 billion, the initial estimate of the bond=20\\nsale.=20\\nIf the bond sale is delayed, he said, the state could end up paying a highe=\\nr=20\\ninterest rate on the bridge loan, which comes due Aug. 29.=20\\nTim Gage, Davis\\' finance director, said in a news release Wednesday that it=\\n=20\\nwas Angelides\\' bond underwriter, J.P. Morgan, who told him that more than $=\\n10=20\\nbillion might be needed. Gage said Angelides is well aware that the=20\\nDepartment of Water Resources, which is buying power on behalf of the state=\\n,=20\\nhas gone to great lengths to estimate how much money it needs.=20\\nDavis has come under fire from legislators, the media and others for not=20\\ndisclosing more details about power purchases.

Recent polls by Assembly Democrats and the Service=20\\nEmployees International Union have shown Davis\\' popularity -- and that of=\\n=20\\nother incumbent lawmakers -- dropping like a stone.=20\\nAs the crisis deepens, there are mounting calls in Sacramento for the state=\\n=20\\nto use the power of eminent domain to take over private power plants.=20\\nCalifornia\\'s flawed 1996 deregulation plan required major utilities to sell=\\n=20\\nmany of their power plants to private companies. State Sens. Don Perata,=20\\nD-Oakland, and Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, are among those calling for t=\\nhe=20\\nstate to start seizing them.=20\\nSuch a drastic measure is little more than talk right now.=20\\nDrawing just as much attention is a bill by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-=\\n=20\\nSan Leandro, that would impose a windfall-profit tax on the generators.=20\\nGENERATORS\\' PROFITS UP\\nMany generators have seen their bottom lines swell as wholesale electricity=\\n=20\\nprices skyrocketed. Lawmakers have yet to define \"windfall profits,\" but so=\\nme=20\\nfavor penalizing generators that sell electricity at rates higher than=20\\nregulators deem \"fair and reasonable.\"=20\\nThe tax would allow some of the profits to be returned to consumers or to t=\\nhe=20\\nstate, which has spent around $4 billion buying electricity since Jan. 17.=\\n=20\\nAlthough any windfall-profit tax has a long way to go before reaching Davis=\\n\\'=20\\ndesk, the governor said yesterday that it is an idea worth considering.=20\\n\"I\\'m not saying I would sign it or not sign it,\" Davis said, \"but having a=\\n=20\\nbill working its way through the Legislature is not an entirely unpleasant=\\n=20\\neffect.\"=20\\nAnything that might help consumers is sure to please Davis, who is taking=\\n=20\\nheat because of a Public Utilities Commission decision allowing utilities t=\\no=20\\nraise rates by an average of 40 percent.=20\\nTIERED INCREASES\\nThe increase would be tiered, meaning those who consume the most would pay=\\n=20\\nthe most.

That prompted some lawmakers to speculate he may=\\n=20\\nendorse a smaller increase and soften the blow by touting subsidies and=20\\nrebates for those who conserve electricity.=20\\nConservation has long been the keystone of Davis\\' energy plan. The governor=\\n=20\\nis pushing lawmakers to pass nearly $1.4 billion in energy conservation=20\\nprograms so he can sign the bills before tonight\\'s address. Such an effort =\\nis=20\\nsure to go down to the wire, however, because the bills sputtered yesterday=\\n.=20\\nThe bills are a cornucopia of grants, rebates, low-interest loans and other=\\n=20\\nexpenditures intended to reward Californians who cut down on consumption.=\\n=20\\n\"This is aimed at giving Californians commonsense tools to begin energy=20\\nconservation as soon as possible,\" said Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe, D-Sa=\\nn=20\\nDiego.=20\\nBut the bills stalled yesterday amid partisan squabbling. The Senate held u=\\np=20\\nan Assembly bill that would spend $408 million on various conservation=20\\nefforts because it objected to changes the Assembly made to a Senate=20\\nproposal.=20\\nThe $1.1 billion Senate bill would set aside $240 million in cash and=20\\nconservation assistance for the state\\'s poorest ratepayers. The Assembly=20\\npassed the bill yesterday after adding several provisions benefiting the=20\\nagriculture industry. Senate Democrats complained the amendments penalized=\\n=20\\nurban consumers.=20\\nDavis has become a tireless cheerleader for conservation, but he realizes i=\\nt=20\\nwon\\'t be enough to end the crisis.=20\\nYesterday, he indicated for the first time that he would support allowing=\\n=20\\nprivate companies and other large users to cut the utilities out of the loo=\\np=20\\nentirely by contracting directly with generators for power.=20\\nLawmakers in January passed legislation barring such contracts amid fears t=\\nhe=20\\nstate would have no one to sell power to.

Today, it\\'s in bankruptcy.=20\\nSophisticated institutions were the primary buyers of Enron stock. But the =\\ncollapse of Enron is not simply a financial story of interest to major inst=\\nitutions and the news media. Behind every mutual or pension fund are retire=\\nes living on nest eggs, parents putting kids through college, and others de=\\npending on our capital markets and the system of checks and balances that m=\\nakes them work.\\nMy firm is Enron\\'s auditor. We take seriously our responsibilities as parti=\\ncipants in this capital-markets system; in particular, our role as auditors=\\n of year-end financial statements presented by management. We invest hundre=\\nds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities, trai=\\nn our people and enhance quality.=20\\nWhen a client fails, we study what happened, from top to bottom, to learn i=\\nmportant lessons and do better. We are doing that with Enron. We are cooper=\\nating fully with investigations into Enron. If we have made mistakes, we wi=\\nll acknowledge them. If we need to make changes, we will. We are very clear=\\n about our responsibilities. What we do is important. So is getting it righ=\\nt.=20\\nEnron has admitted that it made some bad investments, was over-leveraged, a=\\nnd authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors, credit-=\\nrating agencies, and trading counter-parties. Enron\\'s trading business and =\\nits revenue streams collapsed, leading to bankruptcy.=20\\nIf lessons are to be learned from Enron, a range of broader issues need to =\\nbe addressed. Among them:=20\\n-- Rethinking some of our accounting standards. Like the tax code, our acco=\\nunting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have =\\nattempted to turn an art into a science. In the process, we have fostered a=\\n technical, legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the fo=\\nrm rather than the substance of what is reported.=20\\nEnron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for =\\ninvestors to appreciate what\\'s going on in a business. Like many companies =\\ntoday, Enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as Special Purpose=\\n Entities (SPEs) and other off-balance-sheet structures. Such vehicles perm=\\nit companies, like Enron, to increase leverage without having to report deb=\\nt on their balance sheet. Wall Street has helped companies raise billions w=\\nith these structured financings, which are well known to analysts and inves=\\ntors.=20\\nAs the rules stand today, sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liab=\\nilities of SPEs off their consolidated financial statements, even though th=\\ney retain a majority of the related risks and rewards. Basing the accountin=\\ng rules on a risk/reward concept would give investors more information abou=\\nt the consolidated entity\\'s financial position by having more of the assets=\\n and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet; certainly more info=\\nrmation than disclosure alone could ever provide. The profession has been d=\\nebating how to account for SPEs for many years. It\\'s time to rethink the ru=\\nles.=20\\n-- Modernizing our broken financial-reporting model. Enron\\'s collapse, like=\\n the dot-com meltdown, is a reminder that our financial-reporting model -- =\\nwith its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings-per-share=\\n number -- is out of date and unresponsive to today\\'s new business models, =\\ncomplex financial structures, and associated business risks.=20\\nEnron disclosed reams of information, including an eight-page Management\\'s =\\nDiscussion & Analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report. =\\nSome analysts studied these, sold short and made profits. But other sophist=\\nicated analysts and fund managers have said that, although they were confus=\\ned, they bought and lost money.=20\\nWe need to fix this problem. We can\\'t long maintain trust in our capital ma=\\nrkets with a financial-reporting system that delivers volumes of complex in=\\nformation about what happened in the past, but leaves some investors with l=\\nimited understanding of what\\'s happening at the present and what is likely =\\nto occur in the future.=20\\nThe current financial-reporting system was created in the 1930s for the ind=\\nustrial age. That was a time when assets were tangible and investors were s=\\nophisticated and few. There were no derivatives. No structured off-balance-=\\nsheet financings. No instant stock quotes or mutual funds. No First Call es=\\ntimates. And no Lou Dobbs or CNBC.=20\\nWe need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reportin=\\ng model. Disclosurs needs to be continuous, not periodic, to reflect today\\'=\\ns 24/7 capital markets. We need to provide several streams of relevant info=\\nrmation. We need to expand the number of key performance indicators, beyond=\\n earnings per share, to present the information investors really need to un=\\nderstand a company\\'s business model and its business risks, financial struc=\\nture and operating performance.=20\\n-- Reforming our patchwork regulatory environment. An alphabet soup of inst=\\nitutions -- from the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accounta=\\nnts) to the SEC and the ASB (Auditing Standards Board), EITF (Emerging Issu=\\nes Task Force) and FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) to the POB (=\\nPublic Oversight Board) -- all have important roles in our profession\\'s reg=\\nulatory framework. They are all made up of smart, diligent, well-intentione=\\nd people. But the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today\\'=\\ns complex financial issues. Standard-setting is too slow. Responsibility fo=\\nr administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficientl=\\ny certain to promote confidence in the profession.=20\\nAll of us must focus on ways to improve the system. Agencies need more reso=\\nurces and experts. Processes need to be redesigned. The accounting professi=\\non needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer re=\\nview, and address them. Some criticisms are off the mark, but some are well=\\n deserved. For our part, we intend to work constructively with the SEC, Con=\\ngress, the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to p=\\nut these concerns to rest.=20\\n-- Improving accountability across our capital system. Unfortunately, we ha=\\nve witnessed much of this before. Two years ago, scores of New Economy comp=\\nanies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came =\\nto question their business models and prospects. The dot-com bubble cost in=\\nvestors trillions. It\\'s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us.=\\n=20\\nIn particular, we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability =\\nof all players in the system as we review what happened at Enron and the br=\\noader issues it raises. Millions of individuals now depend in large measure=\\n on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth =\\nand security.=20\\nOf course, investors look to management, directors and accountants. But the=\\ny also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best=\\n interest of the company and its shareholders. They trust analysts who reco=\\nmmend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework=\\n -- and walk away from companies they don\\'t understand. They count on banke=\\nrs and credit agencies to dig deep. For our system to work in today\\'s compl=\\nex economy, these checks and balances must function properly.=20\\nEnron reminds us that the system can and must be improved. We are prepared =\\nto do our part.=20\\n---=20\\nMr. Berardino is managing partner and CEO of Andersen.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Excha=\\nnge composite trading, Dynegy shares fell $3.18 to $27.17 each, below their=\\n 52-week low.=20\\n\"There is no question that something as high-profile as this will attract s=\\nenior management\\'s attention for some time,\" said Robert Grossman, chief cr=\\nedit officer with debt-rating agency Fitch Inc., which has had Dynegy on it=\\ns credit watch since Dynegy agreed to the merger. \"The very fact that the l=\\nawsuit is out there poses risk in some investors\\' minds and it could limit =\\nthe upper end of the stock for awhile,\" says Ronald Barone, an analyst with=\\n UBS Warburg.=20\\nStill, Dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy-trading busines=\\ns. Dynegy\\'s president and chief operating officer, Steve Bergstrom, who wor=\\nked for Enron in the early 1980s, is considered one of the brightest lights=\\n in energy trading and Dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipeli=\\nnes, production and power-plant capacity to complement its trading operatio=\\nns.=20\\nAs Enron was cratering last week, Dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on Enr=\\non\\'s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural-gas-sup=\\nply deals. As Enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgo=\\nrge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers, \"Dynegy was a dire=\\nct beneficiary,\" an Enron trader said yesterday. \"When we couldn\\'t do it, p=\\neople just thought `let\\'s go across the street and talk to Dynegy.\\'\" He sai=\\nd Dynegy was offering the best deals late last week.=20\\nSince Oct. 1, the number of customers executing agreements on DynegyDirect,=\\n Dynegy\\'s online trading platform, has increased 20% and Dynegy\\'s physical =\\ntrading business also has increased, Mr. Bergstrom told analysts yesterday.=\\n \"We continue to experience a clear flight to quality by customers,\" he sai=\\nd. \"We will not be distracted by these events.\"=20\\nMany Enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion o=\\nf the company. \"These traders are going to be looking for jobs and maintain=\\ning their relationships will be very important, and they may even be interv=\\niewing at Dynegy,\" said Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co. in Housto=\\nn. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer declined to comment.=20\\nMeanwhile, the two companies are at odds over how to unravel the failed mer=\\nger. In an interview, Mr. Bergstrom said Dynegy sued Enron because his comp=\\nany believes it has a legal right to take control of the Northern Natural G=\\nas pipeline system without delay. In exchange for investing $1.5 billion in=\\n Enron with the help of co-investor ChevronTexaco Corp., San Francisco, Dyn=\\negy received an option, on Enron\\'s biggest pipeline system, that was to ser=\\nve as a kind of consolation prize if the deal fell through.=20\\nEnron, however, says Dynegy breached its contract by backing away from the =\\nmerger and isn\\'t entitled to the pipeline. Enron\\'s lawsuit claims that Dyne=\\ngy contributed to Enron\\'s failure by raising doubts about the company and t=\\nhat Dynegy took advantage of Enron\\'s precarious situation to further its ow=\\nn business goals. \"By terminating the merger agreement, Dynegy sought to pu=\\nt an end to Enron as a competitive force,\" the lawsuit said.=20\\n\"They [Dynegy] didn\\'t have a legitimate reason for backing away from the de=\\nal,\" said Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman.=20\\nMr. Bergstrom called Enron\\'s lawsuit the equivalent of a \"drowning man grab=\\nbing for something on the way down.\"=20\\nMr. Bergstrom said that Dynegy \"likely won\\'t do any\" post-bankruptcy busine=\\nss with Enron, \"at least until they recognize our claim on Northern Natural=\\n.\" He added that \"no amount of money can restore Dynegy\\'s confidence and cr=\\nedibility with Enron.\"=20\\nDynegy has been growing at a breathtaking rate. Driven by gains from buying=\\n an Illinois utility and power-generator in early 2000, Dynegy\\'s net income=\\n more than quadrupled to $500.51 million in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999. D=\\nynegy was expecting to report earnings up 40% this fiscal year, Mr. Bergstr=\\nom said.=20\\nIn addition to buying power-plant capacity and storage, Dynegy had continue=\\nd to expand its marketing reach. Yesterday, the company said it had finaliz=\\ned a deal with ChevronTexaco to market all of the energy company\\'s North Am=\\nerican natural gas. Dynegy already had marketed natural gas for the former =\\nChevron Corp. ChevronTexaco is a 26% owner of Dynegy.=20\\nRecently, Dynegy also received regulatory approval in Europe to buy natural=\\n gas storage assets in the United Kingdom from BG Group PLC, which should g=\\nive Dynegy \"a strong beach head from which to continue to grow their Europe=\\nan presence in marketing and trading,\" Mr. Dietert said.=20\\n--- Tug of War\\n\\nDynegy reasserts its claim on Enron\\'s Northern Natural Gas pipeline.\\n\\nNorthern Natural Gas\\n\\n-- Current Owner: Enron\\n-- Proposed Owner: Dynegy\\n-- Length: 16,500 miles\\n-- Peak capacity: 4.3 billion cubic feet per day\\n-- Location: Extends from Texas to Great Lakes\\n-- Total volumes transported*: 3,139 billion British thermal units\\nper day\\n-- Net revenue*: $500 million\\n-- Other business: Operates three natural-gas storage facilities and\\ntwo liquefied natural-gas-storage peaking units\\n\\n*For nine months ended Sept. 30\\nSource: Northern Natural Gas; Thomson Financial/Datastream\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Morgan, Citigroup Pact=\\n Is First Step; Now, Lifeline Is Sought for Trading Unit\\nBy Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mitchell Pacelle, Jathon Sapsford an=\\nd Ann Davis\\n\\n12/04/2001\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA3\\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nTurning to some of its largest creditors as potential saviors, Enron Corp. =\\nsecured as much as $1.5 billion in new financing from J.P. Morgan Chase & C=\\no. and Citigroup Inc., and was deep in negotiations for an additional lifel=\\nine to salvage its flagship energy-trading operations.=20\\nThe new agreement for debtor-in-possession financing, which will rank senio=\\nr to most of Enron\\'s existing debt obligations, represented a critical firs=\\nt step to keeping the company alive as it reorganizes under bankruptcy-cour=\\nt protection. The Houston-based energy firm is laboring to devise a plan to=\\n navigate the Chapter 11 process without being forced into a hurried liquid=\\nation. The developments came as the Justice Department, following a recent =\\nsimilar move by the Securities and Exchange Commission, began a criminal pr=\\nobe into Enron\\'s dealings, a person familiar with the matter said.\\nEnron has been negotiating with three money-center banks -- J.P. Morgan, Ci=\\ntigroup\\'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, and UBS AG -- for a separate deal to p=\\nump capital into its trading operations through a joint venture that would =\\nlikely result in one of the banks controlling a new trading company, accord=\\ning to people involved in the matter. A spokesman for Citigroup said, \"We a=\\nre not at this time interested in the trading business.\" The other banks de=\\nclined to comment.=20\\nEnron\\'s advisers consider it vital to keep alive these wholesale energy-tra=\\nding operations -- once considered the crown jewel of Enron -- if the compa=\\nny is to have any hope of continuing to operate. In recent days, trading ha=\\ns ground almost to a halt, with the exception of trades with counterparties=\\n who want to unwind positions. Enron yesterday laid off 4,000 people in Hou=\\nston -- roughly 20% of its world-wide work force of 21,000 people.=20\\nLate yesterday afternoon, in the company\\'s first hearing in the U.S. Bankru=\\nptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who wi=\\nll handle the case, approved a series of routine requests by Enron lawyers =\\nto make $48 million of payments on everything from rent at its skyscraper i=\\nn Houston to severance for employees who will be laid off.=20\\nEnron\\'s plan for bankruptcy seems to be shaping up as a multifront effort. =\\nThe company first hopes to calm the markets with its new debtor-in-possessi=\\non financing, then revive its crippled trading arm by putting it under the =\\ncontrol of a new, credible partner. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection tempor=\\narily shelters a company from creditors to provide time for the company to =\\nreorganize.=20\\nOnce some assets are sold to generate cash, the plan is to reorganize -- or=\\n \"skinny down,\" one adviser said -- into a new, smaller Enron around severa=\\nl core assets, such as its pipeline business. Enron has agreed to sell its =\\nPortland General utility.=20\\nThe company will have to clear a number of major hurdles. For starters, it =\\nwill have to convince creditors they stand to recover more by keeping the c=\\nompany operating, at least for a while, than by liquidating the company in =\\na fire sale.=20\\nAccording to one bankruptcy lawyer who has been contacted by several credit=\\nors, it isn\\'t yet obvious to creditors \"that recoveries will be higher by k=\\neeping the company going.\"=20\\nThe list of creditors in the case, the largest bankruptcy filing ever with =\\nmore than $31 billion in reported debt and billions more in as-yet unreport=\\ned off-balance-sheet liabilities, runs to more than 50 pages, and the most =\\npowerful of the bunch are expected to maneuver aggressively for control of =\\nthe official creditors\\' committee. All told, Enron\\'s top 10 bank lenders ac=\\ncount for between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion of on- and off-balance-shee=\\nt debt, one person involved in the workout said.=20\\nAmong those with the most exposure are J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Deutsche Ban=\\nk AG, Credit Suisse Group\\'s Credit Suisse First Boston, Royal Bank of Scotl=\\nand Group PLC and Bank of America Corp., according to a senior banker invol=\\nved in the workout. Some of these banks have exposure of as much as $1 bill=\\nion, the banker said, in a variety of loans or other forms of credit, inclu=\\nding both secured and unsecured. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its exposure wit=\\nhin that range. The other banks declined to comment, citing client privileg=\\ne.=20\\n\"There will be jockeying between and among the bank creditors, the bondhold=\\ners, and the trade creditors,\" predicted one lawyer who has been contacted =\\nby several clients involved in the process. The creditors who control the c=\\nommittee, which is expected to take as long as several weeks to be formed, =\\nwill be able to steer the creditors\\' positions in court.=20\\nAs all of this is going on, the Justice Department has decided to open a cr=\\niminal investigation into the company, a person close to the matter said, l=\\neading to competition among federal attorneys\\' offices that want to take th=\\ne lead. Offices in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston have al=\\nl expressed interest. The probe comes in addition to an SEC investigation i=\\nnto Enron and Arthur Andersen LLP\\'s audit work for the company.=20\\nHouse members in Washington are also gearing up for an investigation. Ken J=\\nohnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said commi=\\nttee representatives will be briefed by the general counsel and enforcement=\\n chief of the SEC today. Tomorrow, top officials from Arthur Andersen and t=\\nhe Financial Accounting Standards Board are meeting with committee staff in=\\n separate venues and on Thursday, three committee investigators are headed =\\nto Houston to speak with Enron executives. \"The committee is moving aggress=\\nively to pinpoint what went wrong with Enron to see what if anything Congre=\\nss can do to make sure it doesn\\'t happen again,\" Mr. Johnson said.=20\\nFor Enron, the key to survival may well be its ability to convince creditor=\\ns not to rush the process. One bankruptcy expert noted that creditors of Dr=\\nexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a securities company that sought bankruptcy prot=\\nection a decade ago, agreed to a multiyear unwinding of assets, which led t=\\no higher recovery to creditors than initially expected.=20\\nThe debtor-in-possession financing will be doled out to Enron in three inst=\\nallments, beginning with a $250 million piece this week, which was approved=\\n by the court yesterday. That money, which will be syndicated to other bank=\\n lenders, will be used in part to repay some of an existing $1 billion cred=\\nit line extended earlier by Citigroup and J.P. Morgan.=20\\nThe new money will be secured by Enron assets, including proceeds from its =\\nsale of the Portland General utility, and by other pipeline assets. A senio=\\nr banker involved in the deal said despite assumptions in the market that E=\\nnron has pledged all of its assets to raise money, the banks in this latest=\\n round have had little problem finding available assets for further financi=\\nng.=20\\nIn the court hearing, Enron\\'s lawyers said the company has $500 million in =\\ncash.=20\\nThe bankruptcy filings of Enron and its affiliates reveal a dizzying array =\\nof creditors, ranging from banks to telecommunications firms such as Level =\\n3 Communications Inc. and 360networks Inc. Enron\\'s loans, in some cases, ha=\\nve been syndicated to as many as 100 lenders and investors.=20\\nAs a result, the pain for banks is likely to be felt widely, but not necess=\\narily deeply. The hit to the top lenders with as much as $1 billion in expo=\\nsure to Enron is likely to be a fraction of their loan portfolios, which ar=\\ne measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars.=20\\nYet while wide distribution helps limit the damage to each lender, it can m=\\nake the bankruptcy process even more complicated. \"When you have a syndicat=\\nion that large, you often have large constituencies forming sometimes with =\\ncross purposes,\" said Walter Einhorn, president of Sunrock Capital Corp., a=\\nn asset-based lender with experience in workouts. \"You never know who\\'s goi=\\nng to upset the apple cart.\"=20\\nAnother potential stumbling block to Enron\\'s restructuring effort is the my=\\nriad off-balance-sheet partnerships that were key to many of Enron\\'s transa=\\nctions. Creditors have yet to receive a clear picture of these liabilities,=\\n which bankers involved in the process have put at around $27 billion.=20\\n---=20\\nMichael Schroeder and John Emshwiller contributed to this article.=20\\n--- Keeping the Lights On\\n\\nEnron is maneuvering to continue operating as it seeks to reorganize\\nunder Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

That\\'s the number of attorneys New Yo=\\nrk law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, Enron\\'s bankruptcy counsel, says it had=\\n on the case before it was filed over the weekend in federal bankruptcy cou=\\nrt in New York.\\nEnron\\'s Chapter 11 filing, one of the largest in corporate history, is also=\\n apt to be one of the most lucrative -- for lawyers representing the compan=\\ny and those counseling its creditors, as well as an expected army of financ=\\nial advisers and turnaround pros.=20\\nThe slackening economy and the burst of large Chapter 11 cases -- five of t=\\nhe 15 biggest Chapter 11s of all time have been filed this year -- have lef=\\nt the formerly insular bankruptcy bar busier than ever and with a new cache=\\nt. With demand growing, rates are rising, reaching $700 an hour for the top=\\n lawyers. That is starting to put bankruptcy lawyers in the same league wit=\\nh merger specialists and trial attorneys. The pending Chapter 11 case of PG=\\n&E Corp.\\'s utility unit this spring, some experts predict, could generate l=\\negal and other fees topping $400 million.=20\\n\"The phone has been jumping off the hook,\" said Andrew Rahl, a partner and =\\nbankruptcy specialist at Anderson Kill & Olick in New York. Mr. Rahl says h=\\nis firm already has been retained by one client in the Enron case, who he d=\\neclines to identify, and is actively negotiating with two others.=20\\nBesides Weil, Enron has retained New York firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meaghe=\\nr & Flom as \"special counsel\" to represent its outside board members, among=\\n other tasks. Heading the team: mergers specialist Peter Atkins, best known=\\n for representing a special committee of RJR Nabisco Inc. in the $25 billio=\\nn takeover fight celebrated in the best-selling book, \"Barbarians at the Ga=\\nte.\"=20\\nEnron\\'s bank creditors, who hold a chunk of the company\\'s $13 billion in de=\\nbt, have lined up two large Wall Street firms of their own. Shearman & Ster=\\nling is advising longtime client Citigroup Inc.\\'s Citibank while J.P. Morga=\\nn Chase & Co. has retained Davis, Polk & Wardwell, and partner Donald Berns=\\ntein, a restructuring specialist who has represented the bank in the pendin=\\ng Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chapter 11 proceeding, also in New York, among othe=\\nrs. Among other major creditor firms is Boston\\'s Bingham Dana, which has be=\\nen retained by the structured-finance unit of General Electric Co.\\'s Genera=\\nl Electric Capital Corp.=20\\nLitigation between Enron and its erstwhile merger partner, Dynegy Inc., is =\\nalso expected to trigger many billable hours. Dynegy, which sued Enron yest=\\nerday, seeking the right to complete the acquisition of Enron\\'s crown jewel=\\n pipeline system, has retained Houston firm Baker Botts, along with Akin Gu=\\nmp Strauss Hauer & Feld, based in Dallas and Washington. Enron, which launc=\\nhed its own pre-emptive lawsuit in bankruptcy court on Sunday against Dyneg=\\ny, is represented by Weil securities litigator Greg Danilow and corporate c=\\nhief Thomas Roberts, who recently handled AMR Corp.\\'s acquisition of Trans =\\nWorld Airlines in Delaware bankruptcy court.=20\\nMartin Bienenstock, Weil Gotshal\\'s chief bankruptcy lawyer on the Enron cas=\\ne, said rates of firm partners likely to be involved in the matter range fr=\\nom $450 to $700 an hour. Mr. Bienenstock, who charges a $675 hourly rate, h=\\nas recently represented holders of millions in bonds issued by Excite@Home =\\nCorp., as well as such bankruptcy-law debtors as Ames Department Stores Inc=\\n. and G-I Holdings Inc., an asbestos concern.

But for now, few of Enron\\'s many=\\n unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover, thank=\\ns to Enron\\'s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked aw=\\nay in partnerships not consolidated onto the company\\'s balance sheet.\\nIn its Chapter 11 filing, Enron Corp. listed $13.15 billion in debt. When c=\\nombined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedi=\\nngs, on-balance-sheet debt totals $31.24 billion. Some bankers who are invo=\\nlved estimate the parent company has an additional $27 billion in off-balan=\\nce-sheet and contingent liabilities. The combined list of creditors attache=\\nd to Enron\\'s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long.=20\\nPrecisely because there are so many claims, the contesting among Enron\\'s cr=\\neditors is expected to be especially fierce. While bankruptcy law specifies=\\n a clear ranking of claims -- with senior secured creditors at the top of t=\\nhe pyramid, the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at=\\n the bottom -- bankruptcy proceedings aren\\'t always set in stone.=20\\n\"Chapter 11 is the only place in the legal system where you can alter the r=\\nights of one creditor against another and alter the distribution of losses,=\\n\" said Stephen Case, a bankruptcy lawyer with Davis Polk Wardell in New Yor=\\nk.=20\\nIn coming weeks, Enron will file other legal documents that will be widely =\\nscrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors, who buy distresse=\\nd debt, for information about the ultimate value of the company.=20\\nUntil now, many distressed-debt players have been on the sidelines, citing =\\nthe impossibility of understanding Enron\\'s business operations, the extent =\\nof its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain m=\\nisstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by Enron.=20\\n\"Traditionally, immediately after a bankruptcy filing, a flurry of opportun=\\nistic investors will look at the company,\" said Edward Tillinghast, a bankr=\\nuptcy lawyer with Coudert Brothers in New York. \"It is easier to analyze af=\\nter bankruptcy because so much more information becomes available.\"=20\\n\"After a filing, the paper tends to get concentrated,\" added Mr. Case of Da=\\nvis Polk. \"Many institutional investors have to dump their securities becau=\\nse they don\\'t want to be seen in [or aren\\'t allowed to hold] defaulted pape=\\nr. So they call the vulture funds and ask them to take it off their hands.\"=\\n=20\\nComplicating the negotiations: Claimants and creditors are a varied lot wit=\\nh diverse interests, reflecting Enron\\'s combination of physical and financi=\\nal assets -- thousands and thousands of financial contracts, whose value is=\\n uncertain and likely to be highly contentious.=20\\nUsually, it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a sha=\\nre of the assets. In order to compete, the savviest creditors, such as the =\\ndistressed-debt funds, which usually acquire debt positions at discounted p=\\nrices, engage in a variety of strategies. For instance, they may threaten s=\\nenior classes with the specter of a long drawn-out legal battle unless conc=\\nessions are made. Or, because each class of creditors gets to vote on any s=\\nettlement, one party may buy up others\\' claims in order to control just ove=\\nr a third of the debt of that class -- enough to influence the entire outco=\\nme.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But after that, Enron never had a chance. It was destined to join Frui=\\nt of the Loom Inc., Trans World Airlines, PSINet Inc. and others that spira=\\nled downward after emblazoning their brand names on sports stadiums. It\\'s a=\\ns if putting a corporate name on a stadium is an act of such hubris that th=\\ne sports gods demand retribution.\\nFor Fruit of the Loom, that meant filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protecti=\\non in 1999, three years after putting its Pro Player athletic-wear label on=\\n Miami\\'s football and baseball stadium. TWA took down its shingle from the =\\nhome of football\\'s St. Louis Rams earlier this year, after being acquired o=\\nut of bankruptcy by American Airlines. And PSINet, a new-economy telecom fi=\\nrm that agreed in 1999 to pay more than $100 million over 20 years for nami=\\nng rights to the Baltimore Ravens\\' new football stadium, filed for bankrupt=\\ncy protection in June.=20\\nCall it the stadium-naming jinx. \"As soon as you put your name on something=\\n, you might as well go to the lawyers and draw up the bankruptcy petition,\"=\\n jokes Paul Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Cent=\\ner at the University of Oregon.=20\\nShares of 3Com Corp., the maker of computer-networking equipment, were trad=\\ning at $39.50 on Sept. 7, 1995, when it agreed to pay $1 million a year to =\\nput its name on San Francisco\\'s windswept Candlestick Park, generating howl=\\ns of local protest. Six years, several corporate reorganizations and one te=\\nch downturn later, 3Com last month said it had had enough and told football=\\n\\'s San Francisco 49ers it didn\\'t want to renew. 3Com shares closed at $4.66=\\n in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday.=20\\nCompaq Computer Corp. doubled down on stadiums, attaching its name to indoo=\\nr arenas in Houston, its hometown, and in San Jose, Calif. Now, Compaq is s=\\ntruggling to sell itself to Hewlett-Packard Co. Edison International, namer=\\n of the Anaheim Angels\\' Edison Field, saw its Southern California Edison Co=\\n. unit flirt with bankruptcy after California deregulated its electricity m=\\narket. Most recently, ANC Rental Corp., parent of National Car Rental, file=\\nd for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 13, raising questions about the home of=\\n hockey\\'s Florida Panthers.=20\\nThe hex is fodder for sports fans from the boardroom to the bleachers. \"Wil=\\nl it create some kind of stigma, and will people ask about it? Yes,\" says R=\\nichard Sherwood, president of Front Row Marketing Services, in Newtown, Pa.=\\n, which works on stadium-naming deals.=20\\nIn Baltimore, many fans had never heard of PSINet before its name was affix=\\ned, in big purple letters, to the Ravens\\' stadium. PSINet\\'s bankruptcy fili=\\nng is \"an embarrassment and predictable result of the shortsighted greed of=\\n ownership,\" says attorney and football fan Neil Brafman. He suggests renam=\\ning the ballpark \"Creditors\\' Committee Stadium.\" In Houston, longtime Astro=\\n season-ticket holder Steve Cross proposes that Enron Field be renamed \"Enr=\\non Folds.\"=20\\n\"That way you\\'d only have to change a couple of letters,\" says the 58-year-=\\nold financial adviser.=20\\nOn-the-field success is no antidote. The Astros won their division this yea=\\nr. The Ravens won the Super Bowl in January, as PSINet was sliding toward b=\\nankruptcy. Their predecessors as NFL champs were the Rams, playing under TW=\\nA\\'s soon-to-be-gone logo. \"Maybe I should run a regression to see if I shou=\\nld bet the team and short the company,\" says New York hedge-fund manager Se=\\nth Tobias. Mr. Tobias says he likes just two of the stadium-namers as stock=\\ns: Qualcomm Corp. and FedEx Corp.=20\\nIn August 2000, once-high-flying Internet incubator CMGI Inc. agreed to pay=\\n football\\'s New England Patriots more than $114 million over 15 years to pu=\\nt its name on the Patriots\\' new stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Watching the new =\\nstadium rise in the distance while attending a Patriots game earlier this y=\\near, Mr. Tobias says he wondered to himself whether CMGI would still exist =\\nby the time the new stadium opens next August. CMGI had a net loss of $5.4 =\\nbillion for the fiscal year ended July 31. Its shares, listed on the Nasdaq=\\n Stock Market, have fallen from $150 in early 2000 to $1.90 yesterday.=20\\nStadiums have carried corporate monikers ever since men such as William Wri=\\ngley and August Busch put their names on stadiums used by teams they owned.=\\n But the commercial name-game really started in 1973, when Rich Foods paid =\\n$1.5 million to put its name on the home of football\\'s Buffalo Bills for 25=\\n years. It was another 15 years before Atlantic Richfield Co. and Great Wes=\\ntern Financial Corp. put their names on basketball arenas in Sacramento, Ca=\\nlif., and Los Angeles in 1988. Now, there are 62 major-league stadiums spor=\\nting the names of companies, which have agreed to pay a collective $3.4 bil=\\nlion for the privilege, over as long as 30 years, according to Dean Bonham,=\\n a naming-rights consultant in Denver.=20\\nAs the deals have multiplied, the jinx has spread. Beyond bankruptcies and =\\nother brushes with death, corporate stadium-namers are frequent takeover ta=\\nrgets. Arco, for example, was acquired by BP PLC last year. Pacific Telesis=\\n, parent of Pacific Bell, agreed to be acquired by SBC Communications the d=\\nay before it announced a $50 million naming-rights deal with the San Franci=\\nsco Giants in 1996. Shawmut National Corp. paid to put its name on a new in=\\ndoor arena in Boston in 1993, but the company was acquired by FleetBoston F=\\ninancial Corp. before a single game was played. The Philadelphia arena form=\\nerly known as the CoreStates Center morphed into the First Union Center and=\\n will become the Wachovia Center as soon as next summer.=20\\nThe deteriorating financial health of airlines imperils naming deals at six=\\n indoor arenas. The former chief executive of UAL Corp., whose United Airli=\\nnes unit named the arena in Chicago, raised the prospect of filing for bank=\\nruptcy next year. Some analysts believe the parent of America West Airlines=\\n, namer of the arena in Phoenix, may have to file sooner, if it doesn\\'t get=\\n requested government aid.=20\\nNot every naming-rights deal leads inexorably to a company\\'s demise. Genera=\\nl Motors Corp. (whose name graces the arena of hockey\\'s Vancouver Canucks) =\\nand PepsiCo Inc. (the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche) are in no dang=\\ner of disappearing. (Of course, the same would have been said about Enron a=\\n few months ago.) Those who pay the big bucks believe they are getting thei=\\nr money\\'s worth for stadium deals, through improved name recognition and an=\\n association with active lifestyles.=20\\n\"It provided a unique branding opportunity that only comes around every so =\\noften,\" says Robert Waldrop, senior vice president of communications at Rel=\\niant Resources Inc., another Houston energy firm. Reliant last year agreed =\\nto pay roughly $300 million over 32 years to put its name on a football sta=\\ndium for the Houston Texans, who will begin play next year, and adjacent li=\\nvestock show and convention center. Mr. Waldrop says it would be \"a real lo=\\nng stretch\" to associate Enron\\'s woes with its stadium-naming deal.=20\\nConsultants say the deals are particularly useful for companies that are no=\\nt household names, such as European electronics giants Telefon AB L.M. Eric=\\nsson and Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV. Philips uses part of the Atlan=\\nta arena that it named as a showcase for its products.=20\\nStill, consultants say prices for stadium-naming deals are drifting lower, =\\nbecause of the weak economy and the disappearance of Internet firms, many o=\\nf which were active bidders. More than a dozen U.S. stadiums and arenas are=\\n seeking sponsors, including the Superdome in New Orleans, home to February=\\n\\'s Super Bowl, Comiskey Park in Chicago, and the former Trans World Dome in=\\n St. Louis. Wayne Huizenga, who owns the Dolphins and Pro Player Stadium, h=\\nas been seeking a replacement sponsor for more than a year.=20\\nSome companies say they\\'ve learned to shy away. \"It\\'s very expensive,\" says=\\n Kristin Schroer, a spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines, one of the few majo=\\nr airlines that doesn\\'t have its name on an arena. \"We would rather be able=\\n to charge our passengers lower fares so they can afford to fly to games an=\\nd still have money in their pocket to buy a foam finger or eat out.\"=20\\n--- The Stadium Jinx\\n\\nWhat happened to the stock prices of companies that paid to have\\ntheir names on sports stadiums.\\n\\nYear Cost of Stock Current Stock\\nof Deal Price Stock Price\\nDeal in at Price Loss\\nStadium City millions Deal Since\\n\\nPSINet Baltimore \\'99 $100 $51 $0.01* -100%\\nStadium plus\\n\\nTrans World St. Louis \\'95 26 12 0.04* -100\\nDome\\n\\nPro Player Miami \\'96 20 35 0.28* -99\\nStadium\\n\\nEnron Field Houston \\'99 100 36 0.40 -99\\n\\n\\nCMGI Field Foxboro, \\'00 114 45 1.90 -96\\nMass.\\n\\nSavvis St. Louis \\'00 72** 9 0.68 -92\\nCenter\\n\\n3Com Park San \\'95 7 40 4.66 -88\\nFrancisco\\n\\nConseco Indiana- \\'98 40 30 3.90 -87\\nFieldhouse polis\\n\\nAmerica West Phoenix \\'89 26 10 2.49 -75\\nArena\\n\\nAmer.

All Rights Reserved. =09\\n\\nHeard on the Street\\nAfter Enron, `Mark to Market\\' Accounting Gets Scrutiny\\nBy Jonathan Weil\\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n12/04/2001\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nC1\\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nWith their industry\\'s pioneer in bankruptcy court, the legions of energy co=\\nmpanies that followed Enron\\'s lead into the go-go world of commodity tradin=\\ng are finding their own profits and accounting practices under scrutiny as =\\nwell.=20\\nWhat ultimately triggered the collapse of investor confidence in Enron were=\\n its indecipherable disclosures for related-party transactions, compounded =\\nby its admitted financial misstatements and massive off-balance-sheet liabi=\\nlities. But many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the =\\nfinancial statements of most companies that trade electricity, natural gas =\\nand the like -- with the approval of the nation\\'s accounting-rule makers.\\nAt issue is a technique called \"mark to market\" accounting, under which the=\\n Financial Accounting Standards Board has given energy traders wide discret=\\nion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in =\\nfuture periods from energy-related contracts and other derivative instrumen=\\nts.=20\\nFor many energy-trading companies, significant chunks of earnings in recent=\\n years have come from recording unrealized, noncash gains through such acco=\\nunting entries. Often, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates ab=\\nout future market factors, details of which the companies don\\'t provide. An=\\nd because of the minimal disclosure standards, it is difficult for investor=\\ns to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market chang=\\nes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.=20\\n\"Whenever there\\'s a considerable amount of discretion that companies have i=\\nn reporting their earnings, one gets concerned that some companies may over=\\nstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make=\\n earnings goals,\" says ABN Amro analyst Paul Patterson, who follows energy-=\\ntrading firms.=20\\nMark-to-market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding e=\\nnergy-related contracts on their balance sheets, either as assets or liabil=\\nities, at the end of a quarter. For example, these could be agreements to s=\\nell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices. Under the r=\\nules, companies estimate the fair values of the contracts. Quarterly change=\\ns in value -- representing unrealized, noncash gains and losses -- then are=\\n run through the companies\\' income statements.=20\\nOne way to gauge the size of some companies\\' past unrealized gains is to di=\\ng through their cash-flow statements, which sometimes specify the noncash p=\\nortion of trading gains. At Enron, unrealized trading gains accounted for s=\\nlightly more than half of the company\\'s $1.41 billion of originally reporte=\\nd pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax=\\n profit of $1.13 billion in 1999.=20\\nAt Dynegy, unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its $762 million in 2=\\n000 pretax profit and about half its $227 million in 1999 pretax profit. Dy=\\nnegy executives say there isn\\'t anything wrong with the quality of their co=\\nmpany\\'s earnings. And they point to financial reports for the first nine mo=\\nnths of 2001 showing that none of the company\\'s reported earnings for this =\\nyear came from unrealized gains.=20\\nOther energy traders whose earnings have been boosted in recent years by ma=\\nrk-to-market gains include American Electric Power, Duke Energy, El Paso, E=\\nntergy, Mirant, Pinnacle West Capital and Williams Cos.=20\\nHow much discretion do energy traders have in valuing their contracts? The =\\nrule, pretty much, is that there aren\\'t many rules.=20\\nFor instance, during a conference last week sponsored by the FASB and the A=\\nmerican Accounting Association, attendees were shown a hypothetical example=\\n under which the fair value of a power contract could range from $40 millio=\\nn to $153 million, depending on which assumptions of future trends were use=\\nd.=20\\nAnd the mark-to-market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafte=\\nd in large part on approaches that Enron and other traders lobbied for. \"We=\\n developed those rules,\" Enron\\'s chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, =\\nsaid in an August interview.=20\\nOver the past three years, members of the FASB\\'s Emerging Issues Task Force=\\n have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy-related contra=\\ncts. What they have decided is that companies should be left to their own d=\\niscretion, though the task force recognizes that could create problems. In =\\na June 2000 report, for instance, the group noted that two companies in sim=\\nilar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value=\\n of their energy contracts, resulting in widely different valuations. \"Thos=\\ne differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practi=\\nce yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value,\" the =\\nreport said.=20\\nThe task force\\'s chairman, Tim Lucas, says it simply is too difficult to dr=\\naft a one-size-fits-all solution: \"There\\'s no one way to do it. There are v=\\narious models, and we think it requires professional judgment to assess.\" F=\\nurther, he says, requiring companies to disclose all the estimates underlyi=\\nng their earnings would produce disclosures so voluminous that they would b=\\ne of little value.=20\\nThat is in line with the industry\\'s longtime position. In a June 2000 lette=\\nr to Mr. Lucas, for instance, Mr. Causey said \"the valuation process should=\\n be determined by individual companies,\" and the task force \"should not add=\\nress the valuation methodology for energy or energy related contracts.\"=20\\nIn its financial filings, Dynegy explains that when market-price quotes are=\\nn\\'t available for certain long-term contracts, \"the lack of long-term prici=\\nng liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitm=\\nents.\" As a result, actual cash returns may \"vary, either positively or neg=\\natively, from the results estimated.\"=20\\nQuoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short-term energ=\\ny contracts have become more readily available in recent years. Even then, =\\nthere aren\\'t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use. For i=\\nnstance, should companies mark their contracts based on the \"bid\" price, wh=\\nich is the price a market maker would offer to pay for a given contract? Or=\\n should they use the \"ask\" price, which is the price at which a trader is w=\\nilling to sell? Or somewhere in between? Currently, individual companies de=\\ncide for themselves.=20\\nOn most contracts for short-term deliveries of natural gas, bid-ask spreads=\\n are fairly small, about 1% or so. But even for some short-term electricity=\\n contract prices quoted on Enron\\'s now-shuttered online trading portal, spr=\\neads of 20% were common. On contracts for short-term delivery of telecommun=\\nications bandwidth, Enron often posted \"ask\" prices that were as much as ei=\\nght times the posted \"bid\" prices.=20\\nFor other long-term derivatives, such as electricity contracts stretching 2=\\n0 years or longer, market quotes don\\'t exist. In such cases, companies are =\\nallowed to base contract valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, cov=\\nering everything from future commodity prices to credit risks and discount =\\nrates.=20\\n\"It would seem wise for energy companies in this highly skeptical environme=\\nnt to provide the disclosures necessary for financial statement readers to =\\nunderstand the quality of their earnings, and provide the disclosures volun=\\ntarily,\" says Tom Linsmeier, an accounting professor at Michigan State Univ=\\nersity.=20\\nFor now, however, energy traders aren\\'t stepping up their disclosures. Dyne=\\ngy\\'s senior vice president and controller, Michael Mott, for instance, says=\\n his company \"is committed to full disclosure and to eliminate any cloudine=\\nss around these disclosures.\" But he says Dynegy won\\'t disclose any informa=\\ntion about the market assumptions or methodologies underlying the unrealize=\\nd gains it has recorded over the years. He says that would place Dynegy \"at=\\n a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\"=20\\n---=20\\nJohn R. Emshwiller contributed to this article.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A Justice Depart=\\nment spokeswoman declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commissio=\\nn is already investigating Enron\\'s finances.=20\\nYesterday, Enron dismissed about half of the 7,500 employees at its headqua=\\nrters in Houston and other sites scattered across the country. Before lunch=\\ntime, all employees in Houston deemed nonessential were told to go home. Bu=\\nt on the way out, many were told that they no longer had jobs, while others=\\n were called at home and given the same message. The move follows 1,100 job=\\n cuts in Europe last week.=20\\nThe abrupt action caused fresh anger among employees, whose 401(k) retireme=\\nnt plans have lost $1.2 billion this year, or on average more than half the=\\nir value, because of the slide in Enron\\'s stock.=20\\nAs employees streamed out of Enron\\'s gleaming 50-story office tower in down=\\ntown Houston, some said they were told to expect $4,500 in severance, no ma=\\ntter how many years of service, and to file with the bankruptcy court in Ne=\\nw York if they wanted reimbursement for any unused vacation days. Others we=\\nre told they would be informed later about severance pay and benefits.=20\\n\\'\\'Almost everyone is gone,\\'\\' said Pedro F. Manrique, a risk manager in the =\\ncompany\\'s energy services division. \\'\\'Upper management is not talking. No m=\\nanaging directors are around, and police are on every floor. It\\'s so unreal=\\n.\\'\\'=20\\nLegal questions continue to multiply in what is already the largest bankrup=\\ntcy in history and may well prove to be the most complex, stretching from t=\\nhe United States to India.=20\\nDynegy Inc., which Enron sued on Sunday for backing out of their merger agr=\\neement, struck back at Enron yesterday with its own lawsuit, saying that it=\\ns competitor\\'s behavior is \\'\\'one more example of Enron\\'s failure to take re=\\nsponsibility for its own demise.\\'\\' Dynegy is asking the court to force Enro=\\nn to transfer its crown jewel, a natural gas pipeline, to Dynegy. Dynegy\\'s =\\nstock fell more than 10 percent yesterday, to $27.17, hitting its lowest po=\\nint in intraday trading since March 2000.=20\\nIn Washington, staff members from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, =\\nwhich is investigating Enron\\'s collapse, expect to discuss the matter today=\\n with the S.E.C.\\'s enforcement chief and general counsel. Tomorrow, they pl=\\nan to meet with senior executives from Arthur Andersen, Enron\\'s outside aud=\\nitor, which has been sued by Enron shareholders and is part of the S.E.C.\\'s=\\n investigation into Enron\\'s accounting troubles. And on Thursday investigat=\\nors from the committee plan to fly to Houston to meet with Enron executives=\\n.=20\\nIn United States bankruptcy court in lower Manhattan, Judge Arthur J. Gonza=\\nlez said last night that he would approve the $1.5 billion financing plan f=\\nor Enron after some minor changes. More than 100 lawyers overflowed the woo=\\nden benches in an overheated bankruptcy courtroom on the fifth floor of the=\\n Customs House. In a sign of how pressed the lawyers have been to respond t=\\no Enron\\'s rapid collapse, a junior lawyer delivered the financing document =\\nmore than an hour into the hearing.=20\\nEnron secured the $1.5 billion credit line through its lead banks, J. P. Mo=\\nrgan Chase and Citigroup. The money, known as a debtor-in-possession financ=\\ning, will provide capital to cover employees\\' salaries and other business f=\\nunctions. The Enron financing is the largest ever of this kind, according t=\\no bank analysts.=20\\n\\'\\'If we don\\'t have it, we may need it,\\'\\' Martin J. Bienenstock, a lawyer wi=\\nth Weil, Gotshal & Manges, representing Enron, told the bankruptcy judge. \\'=\\n\\'If we have it, we may not have to spend it.\\'\\'=20\\nEnron will receive $250 million immediately, and $250 million more as soon =\\nas the company provides the lenders with a satisfactory business plan. The =\\nremaining $1 billion will be used in part to repay $550 million in debts on=\\n the Transwestern Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline.=20\\nThe two banks, which together are owed about $2 billion from Enron, plan to=\\n limit their risk by selling portions of the new loan to other banks, inclu=\\nding some lenders who currently hold Enron debt, an executive said. The cre=\\ndit line is secured by \\'\\'substantially all of the company\\'s assets,\\'\\' Enron=\\n said in a statement.=20\\nEnron is also negotiating with several large financial institutions to rest=\\nart its once extensive trading floor. The aim is a joint venture with high-=\\nrated institutions, which Enron executives hope will give other energy trad=\\ners confidence to resume doing business with Enron.=20\\nBut an agreement is not close at hand, executives close to the negotiations=\\n said. \\'\\'Under the best-case scenario, that would be announced at the end o=\\nf the week,\\'\\' said an executive, who added that the plan could still fall t=\\nhrough and that Enron could be forced to liquidate the trading operation.=\\n=20\\nOne of Enron\\'s most valuable remaining assets is its largest pipeline, the =\\nNorthern Natural Gas Company. Dynegy filed a lawsuit in state district cour=\\nt in Houston yesterday seeking a court order to take control of that pipeli=\\nne.=20\\nDynegy had agreed to acquire Enron on Nov. 9, but canceled the deal last We=\\ndnesday, citing what it called Enron\\'s misrepresentations about its financi=\\nal health and a \\'\\'material adverse\\'\\' downturn in Enron\\'s core energy tradin=\\ng business. As part of the merger agreement, Dynegy invested $1.5 billion i=\\nn Enron, gaining the right to acquire the pipeline if the merger fell throu=\\ngh. Dynegy now plans to take over the pipeline in eight days.=20\\nBut in its lawsuit against Dynegy, Enron said that its smaller rival had no=\\n right to cancel the merger and asked the court to block Dynegy from taking=\\n control of the pipeline.=20\\nYesterday, in a conference call with analysts and reporters, Dynegy senior =\\nexecutives struck back at Enron and provided new information about the fail=\\ned merger, saying that Enron\\'s actions destroyed its remaining credibility =\\nwith investors and customers.=20\\nDynegy\\'s chairman, Chuck Watson, said his company had been working to salva=\\nge the merger until about a week ago, when it became clear that a deal was =\\nimpossible because of Enron\\'s shrinking liquidity, its huge debt load and i=\\nts deteriorating trading business.=20\\nDynegy\\'s doubts started on Nov. 19, when Enron disclosed that it had only $=\\n1.2 billion in cash, Mr. Watson said, whereas Dynegy had estimated Enron wo=\\nuld have more than $3 billion. The disclosure was \\'\\'pretty startling,\\'\\' Mr.=\\n Watson said.=20\\n\\'\\'This basically implied,\\'\\' he continued, \\'\\'that Enron had burned through o=\\nver $1.5 billion in less than three weeks. Neither the treasurer nor chief =\\nfinancial officer could explain where the cash went.\\'\\'=20\\nDynegy officials have also cited Enron\\'s disclosure on Nov. 19 that a downg=\\nrade of its credit rating a week earlier meant that a $690 million debt due=\\n in 2003 had to be repaid by the end of the month. Enron has asserted that =\\nDynegy knew about the debt and that the downgrade took place only after the=\\n merger documents were signed.=20\\nBut in an interview yesterday, Dynegy\\'s president, Stephen W. Bergstrom, sa=\\nid that Enron stated explicitly during merger negotiations that its debts w=\\nould not be accelerated unless its credit rating was downgraded all the way=\\n to junk status -- something that did not occur until six days ago.=20\\n\\'\\'In our agreement, we had a representation that any downgrade would not af=\\nfect any of their debt, unless it was downgraded to junk status,\\'\\' Mr. Berg=\\nstrom said.=20\\nEnron\\'s cash drain accelerated after Thanksgiving, further darkening hopes =\\nof a merger, Dynegy officials said yesterday. By the Friday after the holid=\\nay, they said, Enron informed Dynegy that it was down to $882 million in ca=\\nsh, and by the following Tuesday, Mr. Bergstrom said, Enron had $500 millio=\\nn to $700 million.=20\\nBy that weekend, the Dynegy officials said, Enron said it had worked out a =\\nnew infusion of more than $2 billion in cash that would stabilize Enron\\'s t=\\nrading business. But by late Sunday, Dynegy said, the proposed infusion was=\\n down to $500 million -- far short of what Dynegy felt was needed to addres=\\ns Enron\\'s immediate problems.=20\\nPeople close to Enron have said bankers were actually willing to invest $1 =\\nbillion at that point. An Enron spokesman declined to comment yesterday.=20\\nMr. Bergstrom said that he had been frustrated not just by the cash drain a=\\nfter the pact was signed but also by the refusal of Enron officials to let =\\nhim visit Enron\\'s traders.=20\\nSome bankers and board members had debated whether Enron\\'s chairman, Kennet=\\nh L. Lay, should step down to help salvage the merger, Mr. Bergstrom said. =\\nBut Dynegy never sought to remove Mr. Lay as a condition of the merger, he =\\nadded.=20\\nAs Dynegy and Enron square off in court and in the press, Enron\\'s foreign i=\\nnvestors remain in confusion. In Japan, money market funds have taken a bea=\\nting because of their Enron holdings. Investors yesterday punished the stoc=\\nks of the companies that manage those funds.=20\\nManagers at the Dabhol Power project in India, 65 percent owned by Enron, s=\\naid Enron\\'s efforts to sell its stake would probably be set back. Creditors=\\n are uncertain whether Enron can proceed with a sale on its own or will nee=\\nd bankruptcy court approval.\\n\\nPhotos: Yesterday Enron dismissed about half of the 7,500 employees at its =\\nheadquarters in Houston, including these two workers.

Each ran major =\\nfunds with big positions in Enron bonds. The weakness in financial stocks h=\\nelped push the Nikkei 225-stock index down 3.1 percent.\\nThe stampede left investors with few places to turn for steady returns and =\\nlow risk. In Japan, bank deposits pay almost no interest, so money market f=\\nunds have been popular with pension funds and other investors that seek sec=\\nurity with a reasonable return.

Investors=\\n in other mutual funds also stand a good chance of being burned because Enr=\\non\\'s 10 biggest shareholders were all big money managers.\\nThousands of Enron employees who had big chunks of their retirement savings=\\n in company stock have seen the money evaporate. One Enron board member has=\\n lost billions. Holders of Enron preferred stock are also looking at steep =\\nlosses.=20\\nThat is the inevitable consequence of a stock that lost 99.5 percent of its=\\n market value in a year. Carol M. Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securitie=\\ns, said that Enron had a market value of almost $68 billion at its peak but=\\n that number was about $344 million as of yesterday\\'s close.=20\\nAt the end of September, Alliance Capital was Enron\\'s largest shareholder, =\\nwith 43 million shares. Janus Capital, which topped the list for much of th=\\ne year, was second, with 41.4 million shares.=20\\nRounding out the Top 10 were Putnam Investments, part of Marsh & McLennan (=\\n23.1 million); Barclays Bank (23.0 million); Fidelity Investments (20.8 mil=\\nlion); Citigroup (20.8 million); State Street (16.1 million); AIM Managemen=\\nt, part of Amvescap (14.0 million); Taunus (12.5 million); and Vanguard (11=\\n.4 million), round out the Top 10.=20\\nThe Enron board member, Robert A. Belfer, a New York investor, has also bee=\\nn badly burned, though not as badly as he might have been. At the beginning=\\n of February, Mr. Belfer owned 2.55 million Enron common shares, or 0.34 pe=\\nrcent of Enron\\'s outstanding stock at the time. Though significant, the siz=\\ne of his stake in Enron has been substantially reduced in recent years.=20\\nMr. Belfer declined to comment yesterday on his holdings in Enron.=20\\nGiven the complexity of Enron\\'s balance sheet, Ms. Coale said, it is diffic=\\nult to determine the exact amount of preferred stock Enron has outstanding.=\\n Two identifiable issues have a combined par face value of $2.4 billion.=20\\nThe market value of Enron\\'s preferred stock has plummeted along with its ab=\\nility to meet the dividends payable on the securities.=20\\nAs of the beginning of March, the big holders of Enron\\'s 7 percent preferre=\\nd stock included Franklin Advisers, a money management firm, and insurance =\\ncompanies like TransAmerica Life and New York Life.=20\\nEnron also owes money to many lenders.

The case involves a number of complex legal =\\nquestions and will call into play obscure sections of the federal Bankruptc=\\ny Code, given the complex nature of Enron\\'s energy trading business. It is =\\nalso all but certain to lead to charges of wrongdoing by Enron\\'s directors =\\nand officers, as well as its outside auditor, lawyers said.=20\\n\\'\\'It has it all,\\'\\' said Robert J. Rosenberg, a partner who heads the bankru=\\nptcy practice at the law firm of Latham & Watkins. \\'\\'I sent the pleadings t=\\no my entire insolvency practice group nationwide.\\'\\'=20\\nJudge Arthur J. Gonzalez, a veteran of sprawling cases, is presiding. Judge=\\n Gonzalez, 54, oversaw the bankruptcy of Livent, the now-defunct theater pr=\\noduction company, and continues to preside over the Chapter 11 bankruptcy o=\\nf the Sunbeam Corporation, the appliance maker.=20\\nThe Sunbeam case may prove to be useful preparation for the Enron case. Bot=\\nh companies used Arthur Andersen as their outside auditor, and in each case=\\n investors accused the firm of helping to cover up financial fraud. Anderse=\\nn paid $110 million to settle lawsuits by Sunbeam shareholders and $7 milli=\\non to settle claims brought by the S.E.C.; the firm confirmed last week tha=\\nt it had received S.E.C. subpoenas in the agency\\'s Enron investigation.=20\\nJudge Gonzalez, a Brooklyn native who has been a bankruptcy judge since 199=\\n5, conducted yesterday\\'s hearing in businesslike, no-frills style. Among th=\\ne law firms with major roles in the Enron case are Weil Gotshal & Manges, w=\\nhich represents Enron; Shearman & Sterling, which represents Citigroup, one=\\n of the company\\'s lead banks; and Davis Polk & Wardwell, among those repres=\\nenting the other lead bank, J. P. Morgan Chase.=20\\nLawyers for these and the other firms taking part in the case will quickly =\\nfind that there is little straightforward about either Enron\\'s liabilities =\\nor its assets.=20\\nMany of the company\\'s transactions, for example, involve forward contracts =\\nfor the delivery of goods -- gas, electricity or other commodities, Mr. Ros=\\nenberg noted.

But there is no consensus o=\\nn erasing the legacy of deregulation that the company\\'s political largess h=\\nelped forge.=20\\nCongressional leaders and top regulators are moving forward on what had bee=\\nn Enron\\'s No. 1 objective: a push to reduce local control of electricity tr=\\nansmission lines so that energy merchants like the Enron Corporation can us=\\ne them to transport and sell power.\\nBut the politics of power are shifting, and some of Enron\\'s longstanding op=\\nponents -- chief among them the Southern Company of Atlanta, which owns man=\\ny local power monopolies -- see a fresh chance to slow deregulation, or eve=\\nn roll it back.=20\\nAmong those who have called for inquiries into Enron\\'s collapse are Represe=\\nntative Billy Tauzin, a prominent Republican from Louisiana who is chairman=\\n of the House Energy and Commerce Committee; the Senate majority leader, To=\\nm Daschle, and Senator Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat of New Mexico who is chair=\\nman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.=20\\nAll are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business=\\n reversals in history. And some members of Congress say Enron\\'s downfall, o=\\nn the heels of California\\'s energy meltdown early this year, proves that Wa=\\nshington must demand more disclosure from energy traders, holding them at l=\\neast to the standards of Wall Street firms.=20\\n\\'\\'Enron is the sequela to California, it\\'s all part of the one-year story l=\\nine,\\'\\' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who=\\n focuses on energy regulatory issues in the House. \\'\\'We can\\'t leave energy =\\nproducts in the regulatory shadows. It hurts both investors and consumers.\\'=\\n\\'=20\\nOther influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregu=\\nlation.=20\\n\\'\\'We have had a number of false starts, and it would be crazy not to take a=\\n look at the lessons we can learn,\\'\\' said Nora Brownell, one of President B=\\nush\\'s appointees this year to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \\'\\'B=\\nut we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not wor=\\nk.\\'\\'=20\\nThe Bush administration, along with some Democrats -- including Mr. Bingama=\\nn and William Massey, a Democrat on the energy commission -- continue to fa=\\nvor plans advanced by Enron that would pry open regional electricity market=\\ns.=20\\n\\'\\'We have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of Enron\\'s collap=\\nse,\\'\\' Mr. Bingaman said. \\'\\'But I don\\'t see anything in this that would keep=\\n us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of thin=\\ngs.\\'\\'=20\\nThe durability of such views is a sign of how effective Enron was during th=\\ne last decade in keeping Washington at bay as the company pushed to restruc=\\nture the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy =\\nmarkets.=20\\nEnron and its employees were the largest contributors to President Bush\\'s c=\\nampaigns over the years, and Enron gave more money to politicians in the la=\\nst election cycle than did any other energy company. Since 1993, its employ=\\nees and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, have donated nearly $2 million to Mr.=\\n Bush. In the 2000 election cycle, more than $1 million was donated to fede=\\nral political campaigns, most of it to Republicans.=20\\nMr. Lay also had powerful friends. He recruited Wendy L. Gramm, the top com=\\nmodities regulator in the administration of President Bush\\'s father and the=\\n wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, to serve on Enron\\'s board=\\n in 1993. The appointment came just five weeks after Ms. Gramm helped push =\\nthrough a ruling at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that exempted =\\nmany energy contracts from regulation.=20\\nLast year, as Congress and the Clinton administration debated whether to ex=\\nercise more oversight of the financial instruments used by Enron and other =\\ncompanies to trade energy contracts, Mr. Lay courted Linda Robertson, a sen=\\nior Treasury official who was the department\\'s liaison with Congress.=20\\nMs. Robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives whi=\\nle she was still employed at the Treasury, her financial disclosure shows. =\\nThe measure that became law, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 200=\\n0, specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applie=\\nd to brokers of money, securities and commodities.=20\\nMs. Robertson, who became the head of Enron\\'s Washington office, did not re=\\nturn a phone call seeking comment.=20\\nLast spring, when the Bush administration drafted a new national energy pol=\\nicy, Mr. Lay had a 30-minute meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney to dis=\\ncuss the report. The policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control=\\n of electricity transmission networks, an Enron goal that was spelled out i=\\nn a memorandum Mr. Lay discussed during his meeting with Mr. Cheney.=20\\nEnron also had an unusual opportunity to influence Mr. Bush\\'s choices for t=\\nhe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the markets in whic=\\nh Enron operates. Mr. Lay met Mr. Bush\\'s personnel adviser, Clay Johnson, t=\\no discuss nominees. When Mr. Bush picked people to fill two vacant Republic=\\nan slots on the five-member commission, both had the backing of Enron as we=\\nll as other companies.=20\\nEnron did not always get its way in Washington. It failed to win regulatory=\\n exemptions for some futures products it wanted to trade, for example. And =\\nwith Enron now discredited, its longtime nemeses like the Southern Company =\\nhope to turn the regulatory agenda in a direction that favors their interes=\\nts.=20\\nThe Southern Company has long been Enron\\'s main challenger for influence in=\\n Washington. The company has nurtured a loose coalition of Southeast lawmak=\\ners -- the Senate minority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, most prominen=\\nt among them -- in support of its view that the states should retain leeway=\\n in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation.=20\\nSo far this year, its political action committees have outspent all other e=\\nnergy companies, including Enron and big oil companies like Exxon Mobil, in=\\n supporting members of Congress, according to the U.S. Public Interest Rese=\\narch Group. Southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of loca=\\nl regulators to supervise electricity pricing, production and transmission.=\\n=20\\n\\'\\'We have long felt that Enron\\'s vision of open markets does not work with =\\nelectricity,\\'\\' said Dwight Evans, executive vice president of the Southern =\\nCompany. \\'\\'I think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events.\\'\\'=20\\nMr. Evans said that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under Mr. Bush=\\n had tried to \\'\\'design systems that meet what Enron needs.\\'\\' Congress shoul=\\nd slow the commission, Mr. Evans argued, or risk a fresh bout of instabilit=\\ny and volatile prices.=20\\nSome states have halted the introduction of open markets for electricity. N=\\nevada, Oklahoma and New Mexico are among those that have put off deregulati=\\non, while California and a few other states that once promoted unfettered c=\\nompetition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control.=20\\nEnron\\'s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government int=\\nerference could be another casualty of its collapse.=20\\nAs the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of do=\\nllars -- at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactio=\\nns passed through Enron\\'s trading operation, by some estimates -- Enron scr=\\nambled to hold off Congress and regulators.=20\\nBut some regulatory experts now say that Enron\\'s collapse is reminiscent of=\\n the failure of Long-Term Capital Management. Long-Term Capital was the hed=\\nge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that operated without direct federal ove=\\nrsight and, by some accounts, threatened world markets when its elaborate p=\\nortfolio of derivatives crumbled in late 1998.=20\\nWith its exemption from scrutiny in hand, Enron revealed relatively little =\\nabout its trading portfolio, leaving analysts guessing how it had made its =\\nprofits. Enron\\'s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to =\\nplummet in recent weeks, after the company revealed some unorthodox financi=\\nal arrangements that benefited top executives.=20\\n\\'\\'Enron was getting very heavily into derivatives, and along with Wall Stre=\\net banks, they went to bat to keep us away,\\'\\' said Michael Greenberger, who=\\n was director of trading and markets at the Commodities Futures Trading Com=\\nmission until early this year. \\'\\'This should be as scary for regulators and=\\n Congress as Long-Term Capital was.\\'\\'=20\\nRepresentative Markey agreed that Congress should demand more oversight of =\\nenergy trading. He said regulators should begin requiring transparency from=\\n companies like Enron, while examining the adequacy of their capital and th=\\ne stability of their trading portfolio, much as banking and securities regu=\\nlators do for companies in their domain.=20\\n\\'\\'We\\'ll do it now,\\'\\' he said, \\'\\'or we\\'ll do it when we get the next shock.\\'=\\n\\'\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

When that enterprise is the most admired compan=\\ny in America, lauded by business theorists as the quintessential 21st-centu=\\nry corporation, one wonders if it is the tip of an iceberg. And how many of=\\n us have, without knowing it, booked passage on the Titanic?=20\\nIt will take time, and many legal proceedings, before the full story of Enr=\\non\\'s collapse becomes known. But one thing is already clear: The case shows=\\n how adept corporate executives have become at shifting risk away from them=\\nselves and onto others, in particular onto their employees. Enron\\'s leaders=\\n have walked away from the debacle chastened but very, very rich. Many of E=\\nnron\\'s employees -- no doubt including the loyalists who sent irate letters=\\n every time I criticized the company -- have lost their life savings.\\nBehind this disaster for ordinary workers lies a little-remarked sea change=\\n in America\\'s retirement system. Twenty years ago most workers were in \\'\\'de=\\nfined benefit\\'\\' plans -- that is, their employers promised them a fixed pen=\\nsion. Today most workers have \\'\\'defined contribution\\'\\' plans: they invest m=\\noney for their retirement, and accept the risk that those investments might=\\n go bad. Retirement contributions are normally subsidized by the employer, =\\nand receive special tax treatment; but all this is to no avail if, as happe=\\nned at Enron, the assets workers have bought lose most of their value.=20\\nIt\\'s easy to make the theoretical case for defined-contribution plans. Such=\\n plans expand an employee\\'s choices; he can choose how much to save, and ho=\\nw to invest his money. And more choice is ordinarily good.=20\\nBut the sad fate of Enron\\'s employees highlights the difference between the=\\nory and practice. As Gretchen Morgenson of The Times pointed out on Sunday,=\\n workers across the country have been cajoled or coerced into holding a hig=\\nh proportion of their retirement assets in their employers\\' own stock. The =\\nexploitive nature of this financial incest was emphasized by Enron\\'s now-no=\\ntorious \\'\\'lockdown,\\'\\' in which -- purely by coincidence, say executives -- =\\nnew rules forced employees to remain invested in the company\\'s stock just a=\\ns the firm began its death spiral. So much for freedom of choice.=20\\nAnd even when employees have real choices, one wonders whether they fully a=\\nppreciate the risks. The shift away from old-fashioned pensions coincided w=\\nith an enormous bull market; surely many workers who have never seen stock =\\nprices fall since they became investors underestimate the risk of capital l=\\nosses.=20\\nOne hopes that corporate collapses will not become commonplace. Still, it\\'s=\\n highly likely that millions of American workers will have near-Enron exper=\\niences, learning to their dismay that big chunks of their retirement saving=\\ns have evaporated. They will be left dependent on the one great defined-ben=\\nefit program that remains: Social Security. That is, if it\\'s still around.=\\n=20\\nThe Bush administration\\'s commission on Social Security reform issued its l=\\natest report last week, just as Enron entered its death throes. Most of the=\\n criticism of that commission\\'s work, my own included, has focused on its, =\\nyes, Enron-like accounting: items seem to migrate onto or off the balance s=\\nheet to suit the commission\\'s convenience. Thus when the Social Security sy=\\nstem takes in more money than it pays out, as it does at present, this has =\\nno significance -- the federal budget is unified, you see, so it doesn\\'t me=\\nan anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus. But in 2016, whe=\\nn the Social Security system starts to pay out more than it takes in, there=\\n will be a crisis -- Social Security, you see, must stand on its own.=20\\nBut the commission resorts to bogus accounting only to make the case for it=\\ns ultimate objective: to convert Social Security from a defined-benefit sys=\\ntem, which guarantees retired Americans a certain basic income, to a define=\\nd-contribution system, in which the unwise or unlucky can find themselves d=\\nestitute in their old age.=20\\nSome analysts I know think Social Security will be converted to a defined-c=\\nontribution system, not because it is a good idea but because the financial=\\n industry -- which has enormous clout in our money-driven political system =\\n-- has so much to gain from the conversion. I hope they\\'re wrong. But if th=\\ney are right, the fate of Enron\\'s poor employees, victimized by a managemen=\\nt team they thought was on their side, may truly be the shape of things to =\\ncome.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\\n\\nIn the spirit of the season, Enron Corp. has given us an early holiday gift=\\n. No, it\\'s not sending goodies to our homes or money to our bank accounts. =\\nRather, it\\'s giving us an amazing tale of corporate downfall and hubris. An=\\nd it is providing lessons ranging from the mercilessness of markets to the =\\ndangers of forcing people to tie their living and retirement to the same co=\\nmpany.=20\\nEnron, created in 1985 when Houston Natural Gas combined with a gas-pipelin=\\ne company, swaggered through the 1990s. It claimed it would revolutionize l=\\nife and commerce by substituting the efficient hand of the market for the c=\\nlumsy hand of government regulation.\\nBut Enron\\'s leaders proved to be every bit as bungling as any government bu=\\nreaucrat. Sift through the financial debris, and you see that Enron lost ab=\\nout $7 billion on four dumb investments (details below.) However profitable=\\n Enron\\'s other businesses might have been, paying for those turkeys stretch=\\ned Enron to the breaking point. And it broke. Some $60 billion of stockhold=\\ner value has been wiped out this year. Shares that opened the year at $83 c=\\nlosed Friday at 26 cents. Bankruptcy looms. You wonder if Enron Field, home=\\n of the Houston Astros baseball team, will be renamed Chapter 11 Field. Or =\\nmaybe House of Cards.=20\\nAdding another dimension to the debacle is the intimate relationship betwee=\\nn Enron and the White House. Enron, which for years has tried to ride rough=\\nshod over state and federal regulators, has ties throughout the Bush admini=\\nstration. For starters, Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, were among Geo=\\nrge W. Bush\\'s biggest and most important contributors in his Texas and pres=\\nidential campaigns. And according to public records, Bush intimates ranging=\\n from economic adviser Larry Lindsay to political adviser Karl Rove (who ow=\\nned $100,000 to $250,000 of Enron stock) to Trade Representative Robert B. =\\nZoellick had been on Enron\\'s payroll before moving to Washington. Army Secr=\\netary Thomas White Jr., a former Enron executive, had stock and options wor=\\nth between $50 million and $100 million.=20\\nIn a different environment -- remember Whitewater? -- the combination of bi=\\ng losses and White House ties would have long since produced cries for a sp=\\necial prosecutor to see what (if anything) Enron\\'s buddies have done on beh=\\nalf of the company. The upcoming hearings in the Republican-controlled Hous=\\ne should be fascinating, and there will doubtless be more hearings in the D=\\nemocratic-controlled Senate.=20\\n\"We\\'ve had no contact with the White House\" since Enron\\'s meltdown started,=\\n says company spokesman Mark Palmer.=20\\n\"I\\'m not aware that there have been any requests [from Enron] for anything,=\\n\" a White House spokesman says.=20\\nEven though Enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out, Lay isn\\'t g=\\noing to the poorhouse. Unlike Enron employees whose retirement accounts hav=\\ne been vaporized because they consisted largely of Enron stock the company =\\nwouldn\\'t let them sell, Lay has plenty of wealth left. Last year alone, he =\\nmade $123 million of profit on stock options, according to Enron filings. T=\\nhis year he has made an additional $25 million or so. Note: on Friday, with=\\n its stock at around 30 cents, Enron changed its policy and allowed employe=\\nes to sell it.=20\\nIronically, what brought down Enron from its lofty perch on the Fortune 500=\\n list (No. 7) is that the markets, whose virtue it preached, lost faith in =\\nit after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief fi=\\nnancial officer.=20\\nAnd now, let\\'s proceed to the syllabus of Enron 101:=20\\n1. Bubbles Didn\\'t End=20\\nWhen Dot-Coms Bombed=20\\nEnron, a major trader of electricity and natural gas, grossed $200 billion =\\na year and had $60 billion of assets, but it turned out to be a bubble. Its=\\n business depended on borrowing lots of money. People lined up to lend as l=\\nong as Enron seemed healthy. When suspicions arose six weeks ago after the =\\ncompany revealed its partnership problems, money trickled away. Then it sta=\\nrted leaving in a flood. As Enron tottered, it lost trading business. Its r=\\nemaining customers began to gouge it -- that\\'s how trading works in the rea=\\nl world. Don\\'t blame the usual suspects: stock analysts. Rather, blame Arth=\\nur Andersen, Enron\\'s outside auditor, which didn\\'t blow the whistle until i=\\nt was too late. (Andersen says it\\'s far too early for me to be drawing conc=\\nlusions.)=20\\n2. Deregulation Can Be Dangerous=20\\nIt\\'s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up=\\n, given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems. Besides, breakthr=\\noughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufact=\\nuring plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid.=\\n Letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else. But dereg has =\\ncaused lots of problems. In 1998, the Midwest had huge spikes in the price =\\nof electricity and rolling blackouts: Some utilities had sold power outside=\\n their service areas, and the traders they were relying on to replace that =\\npower didn\\'t deliver. Upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in=\\n several states, sticking established players with big costs. And, of cours=\\ne, there\\'s California, which got caught with too little energy in the sprin=\\ng (helping Enron and others make big profits) and now is stuck with too muc=\\nh expensive energy. This has crippled the state\\'s finances, driven its bigg=\\nest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers. Leaving vital necessit=\\nies such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market=\\n is risky. Especially when a big player such as Enron can vanish overnight.=\\n=20\\n3. Beware Your Own Hype=20\\nEnron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas, and it was the prim=\\no player in that field. But it came to believe that it was good at everythi=\\nng. It wasn\\'t. Some of the debacles: losses of $2 billion each in the water=\\n and telecommunications businesses, and another $2 billion lost in a Brazil=\\nian utility investment. It blew an additional $1 billion on an electricity-=\\ngenerating plant in India. Hence, I think, the need to obscure rising debt =\\nlevels and less-than-stellar results by dealing with so-called off-balance-=\\nsheet partnerships with \"Star Wars\" names such as JEDI (for Joint Energy De=\\nvelopment Investments) and Chewco (as in Chewbacca, the Wookiee). The fact =\\nthat Enron executives were involved in these partnerships and made money wh=\\nile the company got clocked didn\\'t help.=20\\nThe Summary=20\\nThe Enron Affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are.

Meanwhile, Dynegy filed a countersuit against Enron =\\ndemanding ownership of one of its major pipeline networks -- an asset Dyneg=\\ny was promised when it advanced $1.5 billion to Enron as part of its aborte=\\nd Nov. 9 takeover agreement.\\nThe legal battle began Sunday, when Enron filed a $10 billion damage suit a=\\ngainst Dynegy, claiming it was forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedi=\\nng when Dynegy pulled back its purchase offer following intense negotiation=\\ns the weekend after Thanksgiving.=20\\nDynegy\\'s chairman and chief executive, Chuck Watson, said yesterday in a co=\\nnference call that Enron\\'s lawsuit \"is one more example of Enron\\'s failure =\\nto take responsibility for its own demise.\"=20\\n\"Enron\\'s rapid disintegration,\" he added, follows \"a general loss of public=\\n confidence in its leadership and credibility.\"=20\\nDynegy\\'s shares fell $3.18, or 10 percent, to $27.17 yesterday because of i=\\nnvestors\\' fears that the bankruptcy process will tie up Dynegy\\'s claim to t=\\nhe Omaha-based Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, forcing it to write down =\\nthe $1.5 billion payment to Enron.=20\\n\"Dynegy is now entangled in this Enron mess,\" said Commerzbank Securities a=\\nnalyst Andre Meade.=20\\n\"Investors fear the $1.5 billion investment might not be easily converted i=\\nnto ownership of the pipeline,\" said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insig=\\nht, an affiliate of Wall Street Access, a New York-based brokerage and fina=\\nncial adviser.=20\\nOn the broader impact of Enron\\'s bankruptcy, Donald E.

All Rights Reserved\\n\\nENRON\\'S COLLAPSE is by some measures the largest bankruptcy in history, and=\\n the list of victims will be long. Shareholders have already seen the value=\\n of their stock evaporate. Banks that lent to Enron will lose millions. Mos=\\nt unfairly, employees who now risk joblessness may also lose their retireme=\\nnt security, since many had 401(k) retirement plans invested overwhelmingly=\\n in Enron stock. But there might just be a silver lining in Enron\\'s implosi=\\non, for it may bring an overdue revolt against conflicts of interest at sto=\\nckbrokers and audit firms.=20\\nStockbrokers are supposed to analyze companies and advise investors which s=\\nhares to buy; investors pay for this advice. But the biggest stockbroking o=\\nutfits are owned by investment banks that also do other types of business: =\\nadvising companies on mergers, helping them to issue shares or bonds. These=\\n advisory businesses create a conflict of interest: In order to cultivate c=\\norporations that may hire them, banks are reluctant to allow their stock an=\\nalysts to issue sell recommendations on their stock. The \"Chinese walls\" th=\\nat are supposed to guarantee analysts\\' objectivity by separating them from =\\nother parts of their banks are ineffective, and sometimes nonexistent. In s=\\nome banks, stock analysts who are supposedly working in investors\\' interest=\\ns are also expected to work on corporate advisory projects.\\nThis kind of conflict may explain why many analysts continued to recommend =\\nEnron\\'s stock just a few days before the company\\'s bankruptcy. In one unfor=\\ntunate case, Lehman Brothers rated Enron a \"strong buy\" as it headed toward=\\n disaster. It may or may not be coincidental that Lehman was in line to ear=\\nn a large fee for advising on the takeover of Enron -- a takeover that fell=\\n through partly as a result of falls in Enron\\'s stock price.=20\\nA similar conflict of interest plagues audit firms. Auditors are supposed t=\\no serve investors by certifying the accuracy of companies\\' financial statem=\\nents. But auditors also earn consulting fees when they advise companies on =\\ninformation technology and other management issues. The desire to win consu=\\nlting contracts may reduce auditors\\' appetite for dust-ups with companies w=\\nhose accounts seem suspicious. Enron\\'s auditor, Arthur Andersen, earned $27=\\n million in consulting fees from the company last year -- slightly more tha=\\nn the $25 million it got paid to audit Enron\\'s books. At the same time it f=\\nailed to challenge Enron\\'s habit of hiding some of its dicier business in p=\\nartnerships that went unreported on the balance sheet.=20\\nThe conflicts of interest at stockbrokers and auditors, while similar, dema=\\nnd different remedies. Investors themselves are in a position to correct so=\\nme of the stockbroker problem: They can ignore advice from analysts at the =\\nintegrated investment banks, and route their business through smaller indep=\\nendent stockbrokers. But the auditor conflicts need to be fixed by regulato=\\nrs at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The commission\\'s last chairma=\\nn, Arthur Levitt, took a tough line with the auditors; his successor, Harve=\\ny Pitt, has struck a softer tone. With luck, Mr. Pitt will now adopt more o=\\nf his predecessor\\'s outlook. Without objective auditing, there will be more=\\n and more Enrons -- and more and more investors, lenders and employees who =\\nget unfairly burned.\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com=20\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

They just want as much notification as possible to a=\\nvoid the frightening shortfalls of last winter and spring, when power buyer=\\ns frantically scoured the West by phone to scare up any available megawatt =\\nto prevent rolling blackouts.=20\\n\"If the entire amount was dumped back on the grid without giving the grid t=\\nime to absorb it, that would not be such a good thing,\" said Pete Garris, a=\\ncting deputy director in charge of the California Department of Water Resou=\\nrces\\' power-buying division.=20\\nEnron is believed to supply as much as 1,400 megawatts of electricity deman=\\nd by institutional and industrial customers in California, including the Un=\\niversity of California and California State University systems. That is equ=\\nivalent to the usage of slightly more than 1 million average homes, or near=\\nly 4.5% of peak use on a typical winter\\'s day.=20\\nFor nearly a year, DWR has been charged with buying about one-third of the =\\npower needed by the customers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & =\\nElectric and San Diego Gas & Electric. A severe cash crunch and the collaps=\\ne of the state\\'s primary power market left those utilities without the mean=\\ns to buy electricity.=20\\nEnron is best known as an energy trader--once the world\\'s largest--and pipe=\\nline owner, as well as a politically powerful proselytizer for the deregula=\\ntion of electricity and other commodities. But the company also runs a fast=\\n-growing marketing business that delivers power to industrial customers as =\\na kind of utility surrogate.=20\\nEnron continues to operate under protection from creditors under Chapter 11=\\n of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code while it comes up with a plan to pay off its m=\\nore than $31 billion in debts.=20\\n\"So far, the Enron situation has not affected the reliability of the electr=\\nical system,\" said Stephanie McCorkle, spokeswoman for the California Indep=\\nendent System Operator, which runs the grid of long-distance transmission l=\\nines that serves about 70% of the state.=20\\nHowever, some customers have received unsettling \"Dear Customer\" letters fr=\\nom Enron.=20\\n\"They assured us that things would continue as before, but they also said t=\\nhat they are reviewing the situation,\" said Chuck McFadden, spokesman for t=\\nhe UC system, which uses Enron power at seven of nine campuses.=20\\nThe Cal State system, which relies on Enron to light 19 of 23 campuses, has=\\n received no direct communication from Enron, said spokeswoman Clara Potes-=\\nFellow.=20\\nOn its Web site, Enron sought to reassure electricity and natural gas custo=\\nmers that it would continue to provide service. But the company went on to =\\nsay: \"If ... for some reason, Enron does not provide gas or power, the util=\\nity will automatically serve these customers.\"=20\\nThat could be a problem in California, where utilities no longer buy additi=\\nonal power for their customers and regulators have ended the program that a=\\nllows new customers to pick an electricity provider other than the traditio=\\nnal utility. If Enron were to drop customers, they would revert to their fo=\\nrmer utility, and any extra power would have to be supplied by the state, s=\\naid Terrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commi=\\nssion.=20\\n\"I don\\'t think it would be a problem,\" she said. \"It\\'s not like a whole cit=\\ny coming online all at once.\"=20\\nIn a signal that Enron is already pulling back, the company informed the De=\\npartment of Water Resources on Monday that it would no longer fulfill a sho=\\nrt-term contract with the agency to supply 800 megawatt-hours a day of elec=\\ntricity to state buyers.=20\\nPG&E spokesman John Nelson noted that the utility would deliver power to an=\\ny customer that needs it, but regulators and power buyers would have to wor=\\nk out where that power would come from.=20\\nGov.

Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Co. a combined $7.55 billi=\\non.=20\\nBut analysts say the actual amount owed the big banks may be less than half=\\n that, because the loans have been syndicated among other lenders. Banks ro=\\nutinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk.\\nThe big banks also are listed as holders of Enron bonds and other securitie=\\ns, but analysts say many of those securities are owned by investor clients =\\nof the banks.=20\\n\"It\\'s very difficult to piece together the reality\" of lenders\\' exposure to=\\n Enron, said Robert Napoli, an analyst at brokerage ABN Amro Inc. who owns =\\nCitigroup shares.=20\\nWorries about financial companies with credit extended to Enron pushed many=\\n of those stocks lower on Monday. Citigroup fell 99 cents to $46.91, J.P.

But the bank itself probably=\\n is owed $1 billion at most by Enron, analysts say, and much of that is bac=\\nked by collateral such as gas pipelines, on which Citigroup should be able =\\nto collect.=20\\nCitigroup\\'s earnings may be lowered by between $250 million and $500 millio=\\nn before taxes, or a relatively small 3 cents to 5 cents a share after taxe=\\ns, as a result of its involvement with Enron, Napoli estimated.=20\\nJ.P. Morgan Chase--which Enron says is owed $2.1 billion--says its true exp=\\nosure totals about $900 million. Of that sum, $500 million is unsecured and=\\n $400 million is backed by collateral.=20\\nThat exposure could result in a 15-cent drop in earnings per share for J.P.=\\n Morgan Chase, said Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Strauss. The company had =\\nbeen expected to earn $2.02 a share this year and $3.16 a share next year.=\\n=20\\nJ.P. Morgan Chase also acts as a representative for holders of Enron bonds,=\\n so although the company is listed by Enron as a creditor on $1.9 billion o=\\nf bonds, it may not be on the hook for a cent of that debt.=20\\nCitigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase on Monday helped provide $1.5 billion in de=\\nbtor-in-possession financing for Enron. Such new financing is considered lo=\\nw risk once a company is in bankruptcy, because it moves ahead of debts on =\\nthe books before the bankruptcy filing.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Many hung around for hours. They =\\npaced, talked in small groups, and took pictures of each other for the last=\\n time.=20\\nIt was a strange scene, former employee Diane Cook said later in the aftern=\\noon.=20\\n\"The ones who seemed the most depressed,\" she said, \"were the ones who were=\\n left behind. They\\'re going back to their jobs tomorrow, and it\\'s really go=\\ning to be empty.\"=20\\nOnly months ago, Enron had the reputation for being a pot of gold, a place =\\nwhere a secretary could become a millionaire.=20\\nThe high-flying energy trading company seemed to be soaring, and employees =\\nwere enjoying the ride with hefty salaries, lucrative stock options and pen=\\nsion plans.=20\\nBut their company\\'s stock dropped from a high of $84 to less than the price=\\n of a soda at Enron Field in a year\\'s time.=20\\nFor many of the employees, the spectacular collapse of their company is a f=\\ninancial and personal tragedy.=20\\nMany feel betrayed and angry.=20\\n\"These people who made $50 million a year, they destroyed the company becau=\\nse of their greed,\" said Charles Weiss, former director of capacity managme=\\nnt in the broadband services department. \"They\\'re putting families at risk,=\\n they\\'ve destroyed people\\'s retirements.\"=20\\nOne singled out one of their villains.=20\\n\"Somebody said there was a picture of Jeff Skilling being used as a dart bo=\\nard. That pretty much sums it up,\" said Bob Jones, a contract worker who ha=\\nd been employed in the creative services division.=20\\n\"I feel lucky I\\'m so young,\" said Leigh Estes, 26, a software engineer. \"Pe=\\nople in their 60s with many thousands of dollars in retirement, and now it\\'=\\ns gone. It\\'s tragic.\"=20\\nEstes knows that finding a job will not be easy. The information technology=\\n market in Houston isn\\'t that good, she said, nor is the economy in general=\\n. And so many former IT professionals from Enron will be flooding the local=\\n market. Some said they plan to move.=20\\nDivision heads broke the news to their former staffers, giving them about 3=\\n0 minutes to pack their bags and leave. They were given handouts with \"freq=\\nuently asked questions\" about benefits, stock options and health insurance,=\\n but many said that much was still up in the air.=20\\n\"They wanted everybody to go home,\" Weiss said. \"Basically it was just crow=\\nd control to get everybody out of the building without a riot.\"=20\\nLater in the day, New York bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez accepted Enron\\'=\\ns request for $4,500 in severance pay for each terminated employee.=20\\n\"We anticipate that we will make additional requests in subsequent weeks fo=\\nr additional severence,\" said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron.=20\\nBut there is no guarantee the court will give more severence pay for employ=\\nees, said Robert Rice, an employment lawyer with Rice & Associates.=20\\n\"It will depend largely on Enron\\'s overall financial picture,\" he said.=20\\nCOBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, entitles Enron e=\\nmployees to group rates for health coverage for 18 months.=20\\nEmployees do have the right to apply for unemployment benefits.

They\\'ve created their own Web site t=\\no help the job search process and stay in touch. About 4,000 have already l=\\nisted their names on the site.=20\\nMany at Enron know of colleagues who worked there 30 years and lost $1 mill=\\nion or more.=20\\nThat\\'s because many employees grew accustomed to a steady diet of lucrative=\\n stock options that tied them to the company with velvet handcuffs. They bu=\\nilt homes, second homes and bought luxury cars. But now, with their options=\\n worthless, many are worried how they\\'ll keep up those payments.=20\\nFor one employee in the financial mangement area of Enron, losing $100,000 =\\non his 401(k) was bad enough. It paled in comparison to the $400,000 he los=\\nt with his Employee Stock Ownership Plan.=20\\nMany of his shares, which were given to him January 1994, had a strike pric=\\ne of $15 a share.=20\\nIt was a sweet deal when he could resell at $84 a share. But he didn\\'t need=\\n the money and opted to hold it for retirement when the tax hit wouldn\\'t be=\\n as big.=20\\nSome employees blame Enron for a good share of their losses in their retire=\\nment plans. The company was changing benefit administrators and froze asset=\\ns in the plan on Oct. 17, the day after Enron officials shocked the market =\\nby announcing it was taking a $1.01 billion third-quarter charge to its ear=\\nnings to unwind unprofitable investments.=20\\nSteve Lacey, an emergency repair dispatcher for Enron-owned Portland Genera=\\nl Electric, said he watched helplessly as his Enron stock plummeted in valu=\\ne. He had invested all of his 401(k) funds into Enron stock.=20\\nOne 68-year-old had been looking forward to a quiet retirement, buying a fe=\\nw acres, planting some crops and spending time with his granddaughter.=20\\nBut his wife, who had worked at Enron for more than 20 years, lost nearly e=\\nverything. Now they\\'re looking for new jobs.=20\\nThey never imagined that the big, aggressive company would ever come crashi=\\nng down on them.=20\\nThey weren\\'t sophisticated investors and put almost everthing they had into=\\n Enron stock.=20\\n\"We don\\'t know a bond from a stock,\" he said. \"We\\'re just working people.\"=\\n=20\\nOutside the building Monday, police officers on horseback, a horde of media=\\n and clusters of laid-off workers gathered.=20\\n\"There\\'s no more work,\" a former employee said into his cell phone.=20\\n\"It\\'s surreal, isn\\'t it?\" asked Bharat Khana, who worked in risk management=\\n for a year and a half.

But he note=\\nd that the bankruptcy of Columbia Gas in 1991 took nearly five years to res=\\nolve.=20\\nDynegy\\'s second lawsuit claim for damages can\\'t be filed anytime soon, acco=\\nrding to Randolph, because Enron\\'s bankruptcy filing resulted in an automat=\\nic stay.=20\\nThere will be a period of time for companies to submit their claims, he sai=\\nd, which means it will be filed sometime in the next few months. They are n=\\not estimating the size of their claim for damages, such as costs and expens=\\nes, plus the stock price drop.=20\\nMeanwhile, Dynegy is attempting to limit the damage and rebuild confidence =\\namong investors.=20\\nThe industry is sound, and the fundamentals of Dynegy\\'s business remain str=\\nong, said Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. The company is finishing a good=\\n year and expects an earnings growth rate of 20 to 25 percent for 2002.=20\\nSince Oct. 1, the number of customers using its Dynegydirect Web site doubl=\\ned, and the number of transactions grew by 20 percent.=20\\nThe company said it will begin marketing Chevron/Texaco\\'s natural gas start=\\ning Jan. 1, but didn\\'t have details.

Wit=\\nhout a doubt, they said, it was worth every penny of the $3.3 million they =\\nagreed to pay the Houston Astros every season for 30 years.=20\\nBut the past 60 days have been a nightmare for the high-tech energy company=\\n. With alarming speed, Enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival=\\n.=20\\nWith its future in peril, one of the many uncertainties surrounding Enron i=\\ns the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downto=\\nwn.=20\\nWhen baseball fans file into the stadium for the Astros\\' season opener Apri=\\nl 2, will the enormous blue letters spelling Enron Field still loom large o=\\nver the centerfield scoreboard?=20\\n\"If you were to ask me the question today, it will be called Enron Field on=\\n April 2,\" said Pam Gardner, the Astros\\' president of business operations. =\\n\"But there is so much that could happen. Every day could bring a new twist =\\nto this deal. ... We are waiting to see how this plays out.\"=20\\nFor now, Enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the Astros. The b=\\naseball club declined to say when the next payment is due, or how large. Th=\\ne team also declined to say what action it might take if Enron fails to del=\\niver the cash on time.=20\\nFor its part, Enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal, whi=\\nch is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled =\\nin the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history.=20\\n\"It\\'s like every other pre-petition claim,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer sai=\\nd. \"It will become a matter for the bankruptcy judge.\"=20\\nEnron Field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity cr=\\nisis. In Baltimore, the Super Bowl Champion Ravens play football in a stadi=\\num named after a bankrupt Internet service provider. But as beleagured as t=\\nhe company is, it has not yet missed a payment, and the place is still call=\\ned PSINet Stadium.=20\\nIn St. Louis, the Rams play football in a dome that had been named after TW=\\nA. But American Airlines bought out the carrier, and the TWA name has been =\\nremoved from the stadium.=20\\nThe Rams haven\\'t found another company willing to pony up millions, so the =\\nstadium bears the temporary monicker of Dome at America\\'s Center.=20\\nAs dull as that name is, it\\'s probably better than what you\\'ll find in Miam=\\ni, where the Dolphins and Marlins play in something called Pro Player Stadi=\\num. The biggest problem with that is there\\'s no sportswear company called P=\\nro Player anymore. It has vanished, although the stadium name remains the s=\\name.=20\\nIn past naming-rights deals, the heaviest buyers have been high-tech outfit=\\ns and airlines. Both of those industries are in the tank, and it seems unli=\\nkely we\\'ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon.=20\\n\"It is a period of uncertainty,\" said Todd Gruen, managing editor of a publ=\\nication called Naming Rights Deals. \"Once we get a handle on where the econ=\\nomy is going, the naming rights industry can find its place as well.\"=20\\nJust how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is unders=\\ncored by the experience of the Texas Rangers.=20\\nThe team\\'s multimillionaire owner, Tom Hicks, is hunting for a sponsor to b=\\nuy the naming rights to what is now called the Ballpark at Arlington. So fa=\\nr, Hicks and the Rangers have struck out looking.=20\\n\"In our weakened economy, everything is kind of on hold,\" Rangers President=\\n Jim Lites told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram recently.=20\\nSo if Enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the n=\\next 28 years, the Astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corpora=\\nte partner to fill the void.=20\\n\"I am guessing it will stay Enron Field for a while,\" Gruen said.=20\\nIn addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep=\\n-pocketed sponsors, the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition f=\\nor companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill.=20\\nWith no labor contract in place between the owners and the players, the spe=\\ncter of another work stoppage looms over the game.

Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup to=\\n lend Enron $250 million now, another $250 million by Jan. 7 and, if all go=\\nes well, another $1 billion after that.=20\\nThe goal is to ensure that Enron\\'s core energy trading business survives as=\\n a viable entity, by giving other companies confidence they can still do bu=\\nsiness with Enron and expect to be paid.=20\\nEnron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth$6 billion to $=\\n7 billion, said Martin Bienenstock, an attorney with Weil, Gotshal & Manges=\\n, representing Enron in the bankruptcy case.=20\\nEnron currently has about $500 million in cash on hand, down from about $2.=\\n5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began, Bienenstock sai=\\nd.=20\\nEnron may never need to dip into that extra $1.5 billion in cash, Bienensto=\\nck said. But just having the funds available eases its financial stress.=20\\n\"If we don\\'t get this credit, we may need it tomorrow,\" Bienenstock told th=\\ne court Monday. \"If we do get it, we may never need it.\"=20\\nLenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get hi=\\ngh priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and=\\n high underwriting fees.=20\\nEnron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay, who didn\\'t attend Monday\\'s hearing, =\\nsaid in a statement the $250 million will be used to help Enron fulfill obl=\\nigations needed to run its business, such as employee payroll and vendor pa=\\nyments for goods and services provided on or after Sunday\\'s bankruptcy fili=\\nng.=20\\nEnron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of=\\n revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structur=\\ne. Bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks.=20\\nGonzalez also signed off on a provision to let Enron pay up to $4,500 in se=\\nverance pay to workers being laid off. Workers could get additional severan=\\nce payments later as the bankruptcy progresses.=20\\nA small number of employees may be eligible for up to $15,000 to cover trav=\\nel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before Enron sought prote=\\nction from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.=20\\nEnron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its $219 million offi=\\nce tower that\\'s still under construction in downtown Houston. Enron has alr=\\neady paid $180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the p=\\nroperty would need to complete the work to realize any value from the proje=\\nct.=20\\nJeff McMahon, Enron\\'s chief financial officer, was the company\\'s top execut=\\nive at the hearing. \"I\\'m extremely disappointed to have to be here at all,\"=\\n he said during a break in the session.=20\\nAs the bankruptcy progresses, Enron and its creditors will examine the vari=\\nous parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable bei=\\nng sold off or kept as ongoing operations.=20\\nEnron\\'s major creditors will meet on Dec. 12 to form a creditors committee,=\\n which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money.=\\n Enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on De=\\nc. 14.=20\\nEnron\\'s Chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. corporate =\\nhistory. Not surprisingly, Gonzalez\\'s courtroom was packed Monday with more=\\n than 125 attorneys and reporters.=20\\nEnron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its cre=\\nditors after a planned merger with Dynegy fell apart and cuts in Enron\\'s cr=\\nedit rating triggered serious problems for the company.=20\\nEnron listed assets of $49.8 billion and liabilities of $31.2 billion, thou=\\ngh it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings.=20\\nAs Enron decided where to file, it probably considered that Houston and New=\\n York have among the nation\\'s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawy=\\ners in the country, said Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston =\\nLaw Center and a bankruptcy specialist.=20\\nChoosing New York, she said, let Enron avoid local issues hovering around t=\\nhe courthouse. And that includes current or laid-off Enron workers.=20\\nMonday\\'s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a yea=\\nr or more. Despite Enron\\'s statements that it plans to emerge from bankrupt=\\ncy protection with a rebuilt business of some type, the odds do not favor i=\\nt.=20\\n\"It\\'s challenging, but not impossible,\" said Rapoport. \"A lot has to go rig=\\nht.\"=20\\nEighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their Chapter 11 eff=\\norts, said Jack Williams, a law professor at the Georgia State University C=\\nollege of Law and scholar-in-residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute=\\n, a nonprofit think tank.=20\\nThose that fail -- even those that go in intending to reorganize -- typical=\\nly end up liquidating all their assets either in the Chapter 11 proceeding =\\nor converting to a Chapter 7 liquidation case, he said.=20\\nThe biggest potential obstacles to success: a too-small asset base, not eno=\\nugh cash and a poor business plan, he said.=20\\nAs a case unfolds, it\\'s not uncommon for the true value of a company\\'s asse=\\nts to turn out below the company\\'s numbers, Williams said.=20\\nSome companies actually file for Chapter 11, even though they intend to liq=\\nuidate assets, experts said, as doing so gives them more control over a sel=\\nloff. Under a Chapter 7 filing, a court-appointed trustee handles the liqui=\\ndation.=20\\nBefore it filed, Enron had put much of its portfolio of international asset=\\ns up for sale. Any deals now need approval from the court, with proceeds go=\\ning to creditors.=20\\nThe creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is conside=\\nred by the judge, said Joel Kay, an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy =\\ncases at Hughes, Watters & Askanase L.L.P. in Houston.=20\\nThat includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan Enron files with t=\\nhe court.=20\\nOnce a bankruptcy petition is made, the company cannot pay any debts incurr=\\ned before the filing without permission from the judge, Kay said.=20\\nEnron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contr=\\nacts, deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed.=20\\nFor those the judge agrees to let Enron keep, it will be allowed to make pa=\\nyments for future goods and services. Companies with contracts Enron is all=\\nowed to reject will be considered creditors.=20\\nEnron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the=\\n normal course of business. But if it wants to sell assets, borrow money or=\\n do something out of the ordinary, it must ask.=20\\nFor example, if Enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation, the c=\\nourt will need to approve.=20\\nSeveral stock analysts expressed doubt that Enron will come out of Chapter =\\n11 or be able to make its trading operation work again, even if a new tradi=\\nng joint venture is created.=20\\nAndre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York said buyers and sellers o=\\nf energy \"are not going to come back to this new entity in droves.\"=20\\n\"I\\'m having a hard time thinking of a scenario where you can actually get a=\\n workable entity out of this Chapter 11,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to be hard f=\\nor them to reorganize around anything. They may not emerge from Chapter 11.=\\n\"=20\\nHe expects shareholders -- generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in =\\na bankruptcy filing -- will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy f=\\niling.=20\\nThe efforts of shareholders and employees who sued Enron will be delayed or=\\n halted.=20\\nSuch lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the =\\nbankruptcy court to move ahead.=20\\n\\nDec. 4, 2001\\nHouston Chronicle\\nQ&A on the Enron bankruptcy=20\\nWhy did Enron file for bankruptcy?=20\\nEnron\\'s increasing problems -- particularly the reduction in its bond ratin=\\ng to junk bond status -- triggered billions in claims that it could not aff=\\nord to pay. Filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying cred=\\nitors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company.=20\\nHow will the company fund its day-to-day business going forward?=20\\nThe two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day-to=\\n-day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay ess=\\nential expenses -- such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like heal=\\nth insurance.=20\\nAt this point why would anyone lend them another penny?=20\\nAfter filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor=\\n-in-possession financing. Lenders that provide such financing go to the fro=\\nnt of the line when it comes time to get paid back. This agreement, which n=\\normally pays a top interest rate, has to be approved by other creditors. Th=\\ne creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigg=\\ner payout than a complete liquidation.=20\\nWho will get paid back?=20\\nBankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy. First in line are those=\\n with debts secured by the company\\'s property. At the bottom are common sha=\\nreholders. In the middle are unsecured creditors. However, this is all subj=\\nect to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit.=\\n=20\\nIf common shareholders are the last to get paid, why did the stock rise?=20\\nThere\\'s no good explanation. Sometimes at the start of a big case, certain =\\nparties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareh=\\nolders. Other buyers are traders who see a short-term profit to be made in =\\nthe price movement of the stock, which trades in pennies.=20\\nWill Enron be able to come back?=20\\nThat depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to =\\na profitable core. Officials within Enron have warned the surviving company=\\n may be far different than what you see today.

Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New=\\n York Co. more than $7 billion in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. histo=\\nry. Analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that.=20\\nHere\\'s where they differ.=20\\nEnron on Monday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors $31.2 b=\\nillion in loans, unpaid bills and other debts. Citigroup, the biggest credi=\\ntor, is owed $3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year, Enron s=\\naid.=20\\nStill, the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts Enron says they=\\n\\'re owed. That\\'s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lende=\\nrs as a way to disperse risk. Banks also are listed as the holders of bonds=\\n and other securities that in fact are owned by investors. The banks are li=\\nsted as the creditors in Enron\\'s papers.=20\\nCitigroup, the largest U.S. financial services company, is probably owed $1=\\n billion at most, analysts say, and much of that is backed by collateral su=\\nch as gas pipelines, on which it should be able to collect.=20\\nProducers of natural gas have only small exposure\\nA peek at U.S. producers of natural gas on Monday showed none have enough e=\\nxposure to Enron Corp. to force them to follow the battered energy trader\\'s=\\n filing for bankruptcy.=20\\nIn comments analysts said were typical of the industry, Houston-based indep=\\nendent oil and gas producer Spinnaker Exploration Co. said it would take a =\\nfourth-quarter pre-tax charge of $3.4 million based on volumes of natural g=\\nas hedged with Enron in November and December.=20\\nMark Fischer, an analyst for Banc of America Securities, said the money Enr=\\non owed to producers is negligible.=20\\n\"Spinnaker is a billion-dollar company, and $3.4 million is not much of an =\\nexposure for a company that size,\" he said.=20\\nInsiders sold $1.2 billion in stock over past decade\\nEnron Corp. officers and directors sold more than $1.2 billion in the compa=\\nny\\'s stock in the decade before the energy trader\\'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy f=\\niling Sunday, the largest ever.=20\\nEnron insiders, including Chairman Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Offic=\\ner Jeffrey Skilling, sold almost 19 million shares between May 1990 and Oct=\\nober 2001, according to Washington Service, which tracks insider transactio=\\nns. Lay collected $143.7 million from the sales; Skilling, who stunned inve=\\nstors when he quit in August six months after becoming CEO, picked up $76.1=\\n million.=20\\nKen Harrison, former chairman and CEO of Portland General, sold almost 992,=\\n000 shares for $78 million. Enron bought the utility in 1997 for $3.1 billi=\\non in stock and debt. Harrison couldn\\'t be reached for comment.=20\\nThe selling among Enron insiders outweighed the buying during the past deca=\\nde.

Still, Enron\\'s buildings are expected to be in\\nhigh demand in a market lacking large blocks of space for major\\nnew entrants.\\n\\n     ``There are several large companies in this city who have\\nalready expressed interest in one or more of the buildings if they\\ncome available,\\'\\' Bellows said.\\n\\n     Other major downtown office projects under construction are\\npre-leased to anchor tenants that include energy traders Reliant\\nInc. and Calpine Corp., Bellows said.\\n\\n                       Development Postponed\\n\\n     Work on all the projects continues. Trammel Crow Co.,\\nhowever, postponed its $108 million, 34-story office development\\nbecause of uncertainty about the impact Enron\\'s collapse will have\\non demand.\\n\\n     Perhaps the most visible loss to Houston will be the prestige\\nassociated with the company\\'s name, which adorns the downtown\\nballpark, Enron Field. The trader is among three of the city\\'s\\nmost visible employers to hit hard times. Layoffs were announced\\nearlier this year at Continental Airlines Inc., where demand\\ndropped following the attacks in New York and Washington, and at\\nCompaq Computer Corp., which is being bought by Hewlett-Packard\\nCo.\\n\\n     ``If you\\'re the (chamber of commerce), you\\'re out scrambling\\naround for a new icon,\\'\\' said Barton Smith, an economist at the\\nUniversity of Houston and director of the Institute for Regional\\nForecasting. ``Enron was the icon for Houston for the new energy\\neconomy.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n--Jim Kennett in Houston, (713) 353-4871, with reporting by Eileen\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

About 80 coal-bed methane companies operate in the region.=20\\nMany of the companies report fat profits, and some of the nation\\'s largest=\\n=20\\nenergy firms are staking claims in the region.=20\\n\"I don\\'t see how we could be in a better spot,\" says Steve McNelly, who wor=\\nks=20\\nfor a methane company, Well Completion of Gillette, Wyo.=20\\nThe state of Wyoming last year projected a $183 million deficit.

Each well=20\\nproduces about 12,000 gallons of water a day, much of it high in salt.=20\\nThe impact can be jarring. This spring, runoff water from neighboring wells=\\n=20\\nflooded William West\\'s ranch, killing creekside Cottonwoods and about 100=\\n=20\\nacres of hay.

One often-repeated estimate is that the lights will go=\\n=20\\nout on 30 to 35 days, an educated guess based on last year\\'s consumption=20\\nlevels. One local fire chief said he had heard that blackouts would hit two=\\n=20\\nto three days a week.=20\\nBut the agency that manages the state\\'s electricity grid has issued no such=\\n=20\\nestimates.=20\\nLorie O\\'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operato=\\nr,=20\\nsaid blackout predictions are springing up like urban myths, taking on the=\\n=20\\nring of truth with repetition.=20\\nThe real truth, she said, is that no one can say how often the lights will =\\ngo=20\\nout or for how long. It depends on the weather, the daily fluctuations in t=\\nhe=20\\nwholesale electricity market, how much conservation takes place and whether=\\n=20\\npower plants run steadily or suffer mechanical breakdowns.=20\\n\"You can understand the dynamics here,\" O\\'Donley said. \"We have to play the=\\n=20\\ncards we are dealt that day, and we will definitely do the best to locate=\\n=20\\nenough resources and try, but it is going to be a challenge.\"=20\\nGrid managers say blackouts are possible on days when consumption exceeds=\\n=20\\n40,000 megawatts. The state exceeded that level on 34 days last summer.=20\\nBut that measuring stick isn\\'t a strict standard.=20\\nJust this past week, blackouts were ordered on two days when peak usage was=\\n=20\\nabout 34,000 megawatts. Enough power couldn\\'t be bought to meet demand, and=\\n=20\\nabout one-third of the state\\'s generating capacity was unavailable because =\\nof=20\\nbreakdowns or planned maintenance.=20\\nCalifornia got into this crisis after its 1996 deregulation plan went=20\\nterribly wrong. The wholesale price of power skyrocketed, and=20\\nelectricity-generating capacity suddenly was inadequate to meet growing=20\\ndemand.=20\\nCritics of deregulation say electricity suppliers, who have posted huge=20\\ncorporate profits from the higher electricity prices, manipulated the marke=\\nt=20\\nand made the supply situation worse.=20\\nPower suppliers say California, which did not build any new generating plan=\\nts=20\\nin a dozen years, simply does not have enough supply, a situation they say =\\nis=20\\nworsened by a reduction in the availability of hydroelectric power from the=\\n=20\\nPacific Northwest. The suppliers also say increased demands on California\\'s=\\n=20\\naging system of power plants are responsible for the historically high leve=\\nl=20\\nof facility outages.=20\\nShames, who heads the Utility Consumers\\' Action Network, said he expects=20\\npower emergencies to be declared all summer long.=20\\nIt wasn\\'t a good sign that just a few days of warm weather pushed the state=\\n=20\\nbeyond its tight energy supplies, he said, adding: \"It is pretty clear to m=\\ne=20\\nthat we are going to see through May, June, July and probably into August=\\n=20\\nalmost continual Stage 2 situations.

The average in San=20\\nDiego and Los Angeles counties and in western Riverside and western San=20\\nBernardino counties will be about two-tenths of a degree above normal.=20\\nWhile those changes are significant for meteorologists, they probably won\\'t=\\n=20\\nmake much of a difference for most state residents.=20\\n\"You won\\'t be able to feel the difference,\" said Philip Gonsalves, a=20\\nmeteorologist intern for the National Weather Service. \"If you normally set=\\n=20\\nyour thermostat to 72 degrees and you set it at 74, that\\'s a bigger=20\\ndifference than what we are anticipating.\"=20\\nThe ISO has predicted California will be short nearly 3,700 megawatts next=\\n=20\\nmonth, enough to provide power to more than 2.7 million homes.=20\\nGov.

Many of the state\\'s power plants are fueled by natural gas.=20\\nIn 1999, Californians paid $6.6 billion for natural gas, and a year later=\\n=20\\nthat figure rose to $12.3 billion. In the first three months of 2001,=20\\nCalifornians paid $7.9 billion.=20\\nThe committee report, based on two days of hearings last month, said=20\\ncontracts that gave natural-gas marketers control of vast amounts of the El=\\n=20\\nPaso pipeline -- the key entry point for the state\\'s supplies -- helped pus=\\nh=20\\nCalifornia\\'s gas prices above the national average.=20\\nThe report concluded that El Paso Natural Gas Co. favored its affiliate, El=\\n=20\\nPaso Merchant Energy, in a deal that allowed the affiliate to control much =\\nof=20\\nthe gas that flows on the pipeline owned by El Paso Natural Gas.=20\\nThe pipeline brings natural gas from the ground in Texas to homes and=20\\nbusinesses in California.=20\\nEl Paso Merchant Energy offered to resell gas that it owned, but the=20\\ncommittee concluded that it demanded \"unreasonably\" high prices so it would=\\n=20\\nhave no buyers and thus retain control of a large supply of gas.=20\\nThat control, the report said, helped \"artificially inflate border prices\"=\\n=20\\nfor natural gas.=20\\nThe report also said El Paso Merchant Energy had every incentive to drive u=\\np=20\\nborder prices. The company had an ownership interest in 20 \"qualifying=20\\nfacilities,\" which are smaller electricity producers. The price those=20\\ngenerators are paid for electricity is tied to the border price of natural=\\n=20\\ngas.=20\\nDuring the hearings, Ralph Eads, president of El Paso Merchant Energy, deni=\\ned=20\\nhoarding gas, saying the price for natural gas rose so high because of the=\\n=20\\nincreased demand by electricity producers that use natural gas. Eads and=20\\nothers denied using their corporate ties for a sweetheart deal.=20\\nOther industry representatives blamed the increase in price on limits on=20\\npipeline capacity and lower levels of gas storage.=20\\nThe report rejected those explanations: \"The exorbitant prices cannot be=20\\ndefined away by regulators and bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate=\\n=20\\nlawyers\\' wordplay. The economic hardship cannot be justified simply by=20\\nreciting the economic laws of supply and demand.\"=20\\nThe report recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=\\n=20\\nhas jurisdiction over natural gas, prohibit deals that allow one marketer t=\\no=20\\ncontrol so much pipeline capacity.=20\\nThe report noted that something else besides the price of natural gas soare=\\nd=20\\nduring the past two years: corporate profits for El Paso Merchant Energy.

More recently,=20\\nthough, SDG&E has begun pitching the new transmission line as a system to=\\n=20\\nexport electricity from new generators in the San Diego area to the rest of=\\n=20\\nthe state power grid.\\n?????SDG&E insists that those two arguments do not conflict. But residents=\\n=20\\nhave found the company\\'s position disingenuous at best. And what seemed a=\\n=20\\nneighborhood tiff has become something more, widely seen as a harbinger of=\\n=20\\nscuffles to come as California confronts its power crisis.\\n?????The state already has 26,000 miles of electric transmission lines. And=\\n=20\\nin the next four years--according to the California Independent System=20\\nOperator, the agency that oversees the state grid--74 transmission-line=20\\nconstruction projects are expected so energy companies can meet state and=\\n=20\\nfederal reliability standards.\\n?????More lines will be added purely for economic gain, said Armando Perez,=\\n=20\\ndirector of grid planning for Cal-ISO, and similar battles are expected to=\\n=20\\ndog many of those proposals.\\n?????\"There has always been, and always will be, a tension between the=20\\nproponents\\' need for lines and locating it so it doesn\\'t have a terrible=20\\nimpact on neighboring communities,\" said Mark Mihaly, a San Francisco lawye=\\nr=20\\nwho will represent residents in upcoming hearings about the placement of th=\\ne=20\\ntransmission line.\\n?????\"But what you will see is that the power companies are going to be usi=\\nng=20\\nthe energy crisis, trying to hitch their wagon to that train.

That bill, which awaits votes in two Assembly=20\\ncommittees in coming weeks, targets not only future transmission lines but=\\n=20\\nthe proposed line in southern Riverside County, Hollingsworth said.\\n?????\"I object to the fact that private property is looked at as the path o=\\nf=20\\nleast resistance,\" he said.\\n?????In Riverside County, community leaders say they have a series of=20\\nconcerns about the SDG&E proposal.

So Pacific Ga=\\ns=20\\nand Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge,=\\n=20\\nlong-term gas contract with El Paso.=20\\nFor the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on=\\n=20\\ngas pipelines than it needed.=20\\nFor El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pin=\\nk=20\\nslips like they were candy.=20\\nBut in the long run, it wasn\\'t El Paso that would end up on its knees. It=\\n=20\\nwould be PG&E and the state of California.=20\\nThat pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary woul=\\nd=20\\nsoon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with=20\\nbare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in=\\n=20\\nthe world.=20\\nSo big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and=20\\nregulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came t=\\no=20\\nbe plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills.=20\\n\"They didn\\'t mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow=\\n=20\\nback then,\" said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. \"And now . . . well,=20\\nlet\\'s just say they should have planned better.\" -- -- --=20\\nIt\\'s not like El Paso was some new kid on the block.=20\\nThe company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until=\\n=20\\n1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California.=\\n=20\\nIt grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided=\\n=20\\nEl Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings =\\nin=20\\nthe Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had starte=\\nd=20\\nat the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he too=\\nk=20\\nover as president in 1989.=20\\nWise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running=\\n=20\\nand his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of=\\n=20\\noil.=20\\nThe University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal=\\n=20\\nside of his \"litigious\" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball=20\\neconomic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of h=\\nis=20\\nbusiness at its epicenter, Texas.=20\\nThose skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 19=\\n96=20\\nand 1997.=20\\nPG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at th=\\ne=20\\nArizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cub=\\nic=20\\nfeet of natural gas a day.=20\\nThe trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the=20\\npipeline space, $170 million of the company\\'s annual revenue was erased.=20\\n\"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast,\" said Wu, the forme=\\nr=20\\nEl Paso manager. \"Of course, California didn\\'t care at all.\"=20\\nBut Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline=20\\ncompany\\'s case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996,=\\n=20\\ncould see trouble looming for the state.=20\\nIf PG&E and other utilities didn\\'t keep the pipeline capacity to meet futur=\\ne=20\\nneeds, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on de=\\naf=20\\nears.=20\\n\"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, \\'This will=\\n=20\\nbe El Paso\\'s problem,\\' \" Power said. -- -- --=20\\nWise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself f=\\nor=20\\na year and freezing his executives\\' pay, Wu said. While laying off more tha=\\nn=20\\none-third of the company\\'s workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty=20\\nsettlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropp=\\ned=20\\nthe pipeline space.=20\\nThen Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could=\\n=20\\nexpand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States.=\\n=20\\n\"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to=\\n=20\\nget creative,\" Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from Th=\\ne=20\\nChronicle.=20\\n\"Attorneys generally don\\'t have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill =\\n-=20\\n- he\\'s got extra,\" said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. \"He cuts his=20\\nlosses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he=20\\nmoved.\"=20\\nWithin a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full=20\\n\"wellhead to wire\" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling=\\n=20\\nto electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion,=\\n=20\\nCalifornia constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso\\'s natural gas sales --=\\n=20\\nmuch of that to PG&E.=20\\nThe strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso woul=\\nd=20\\nmake sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would=20\\nnever be dependent on one market again.=20\\nWise\\'s company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 state=\\ns=20\\nby April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline=\\n=20\\ncompanies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide=\\n,=20\\nfrom Bakersfield to Boston.=20\\n\"The company was a very traditional gas company until then,\" said Fred=20\\nPickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the=\\n=20\\n1970s. \"Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the=20\\nbusiness, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic.=\\n=20\\n\"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California w=\\nas=20\\nable to see.\"=20\\nBut some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those=20\\npossibilities took unfair advantage of California.=20\\nIn his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney=\\n=20\\nHarvey Morris thought he \"smelled a rat\" as long as three years ago.=20\\nMorris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on=\\n=20\\nthe look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El=\\n=20\\nPaso -- and he\\'s been carrying that look a long time now.=20\\nAfter losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility\\'s entire block of pipeline=20\\ncapacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts we=\\nre=20\\nstunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris,=\\n=20\\nwere even more surprised by what followed.=20\\nDynegy didn\\'t behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected=20\\nenergy companies to behave in the era of deregulation.=20\\nLike PG&E, Dynegy didn\\'t need all that pipeline space to serve its own=20\\ncustomers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra=20\\nspace, Dynegy didn\\'t resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn\\'t=\\n=20\\nsell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly=\\n=20\\nnobody wanted to buy it.=20\\nCompeting gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was=20\\ncollaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into=20\\nCalifornia so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on th=\\ne=20\\npipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold.=20\\nIn 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing=\\n=20\\non the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many=\\n=20\\ncomplaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He\\'s still pursui=\\nng=20\\nthem.=20\\nAs it turned out, spot prices didn\\'t rise while Dynegy held the contract; g=\\nas=20\\nshippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy l=\\net=20\\nthe contract lapse in late 1999.=20\\nNot long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso\\'s market=20\\naffiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that\\'s when things started to get=\\n=20\\nreally serious, Morris says.=20\\nEl Paso\\'s own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into=\\n=20\\nSouthern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for=\\n=20\\ngas was about to soar.=20\\nIn his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern Californi=\\na=20\\nEdison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented=\\n=20\\npipeline space from being used.=20\\n\"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went=\\n=20\\nthrough the roof,\" he said. \"It was the same as closing off part of the=20\\npipeline.\"=20\\nEl Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000=\\n=20\\nsimply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never=\\n=20\\ncharged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove=\\n=20\\notherwise are preposterous.=20\\nAnd thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, th=\\ne=20\\nfree-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded t=\\nhe=20\\ncompany did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorr=\\now=20\\non the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC.=20\\nEdison estimates that El Paso\\'s \"manipulation\" at Topock jacked up rates al=\\nl=20\\nover the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion mo=\\nre=20\\nthan they should have just in the past year.=20\\nWhatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have=\\n=20\\nbeen anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the=\\n=20\\nborder in Arizona, and in almost every other state.=20\\nOnce prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California=\\n=20\\nfollowed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly.=20\\nGas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled=20\\nelectricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plan=\\nts=20\\nin California run on natural gas.=20\\nThe firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the=20\\nutilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of=20\\nderegulation.=20\\nThe problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn\\'t pass those=\\n=20\\nhigher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates=\\n=20\\nwere still regulated.=20\\nSo the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And=\\n,=20\\nwith gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing.=\\n=20\\nBut not for El Paso. -- -- --=20\\nEl Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just=\\n a=20\\nsurvivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of=\\n=20\\nthe energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States=\\n.=20\\nThe company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printi=\\nng=20\\nmoney. The company\\'s revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion la=\\nst=20\\nyear; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise\\'s=\\n=20\\ncompensation package reportedly totaled $20 million.=20\\nAnd it\\'s not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its=20\\nholdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California=20\\nEdison.=20\\nUnder El Paso\\'s contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rise=\\ns=20\\nwhen the price of gas rises. That\\'s true even at the power plants that don\\'=\\nt=20\\nuse any natural gas.=20\\nAll told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison sa=\\ny=20\\nEl Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those=\\n=20\\nplants.=20\\nAnd all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy=20\\ncourt, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight.=20\\nThe one cloud on El Paso\\'s horizon: A host of California legislators,=20\\nindustry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso\\'s sunny profit=\\n=20\\npicture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El=20\\nPaso\\'s natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender.=20\\nThe hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last=20\\nmonth the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top=\\n=20\\nEl Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matte=\\nr.=20\\nIt was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. An=\\nd=20\\nthough the executives grimly waved off reporters\\' questions as they strode=\\n=20\\nfrom the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that=\\n=20\\nthe accusations will blow over, \"because there\\'s nothing to them.=20\\n\"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50=\\n=20\\nyears, and we want to continue being here,\" Dunn said. \"We take this matter=\\n=20\\nvery seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative.\"=20\\nAccusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipelin=\\ne=20\\nspace hostage amount to \"nothing but conspiracy theories,\" she said.=20\\nThe Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had=20\\nmanipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers.=20\\n\"The numbers tell the truth,\" the subcommittee said in a report obtained by=\\n=20\\nThe Chronicle. \"The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators=\\n=20\\nand bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers\\' wordplay.\" The=20\\nreport was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans.=20\\nWise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state=20\\nlawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading=\\n=20\\nhere and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport=\\n.=20\\nWhen it comes to California, \"El Paso has always tried to be a part of the=\\n=20\\nsolution, not the problem,\" he told a gas industry newsletter in December.=\\n=20\\nState lawmakers\\' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have=\\n=20\\nbeen met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary=20\\ninformation. And judging by Morris\\' experience, chasing El Paso to the grou=\\nnd=20\\nmay take the Legislature quite a while, if that\\'s what it decides it wants =\\nto=20\\ndo.=20\\nMorris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company=\\n,=20\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC =\\nor=20\\nput the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up.=20\\nThe Assembly subcommittee\\'s report was scathing in regard to the commission=\\n,=20\\nsaying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts \"raises serious questions=\\n=20\\nabout whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act t=\\no=20\\nprotect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates.\"=20\\nThe commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused=\\n=20\\nto comment on its rulings.=20\\nBy the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening th=\\ne=20\\ncrucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition=\\n=20\\nfor the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morri=\\ns=20\\nsaid.=20\\n\"The damage was done long ago,\" Morris said. The state and its utilities ar=\\ne=20\\non the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter\\'s bills has already=\\n=20\\nleft consumers\\' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come=\\n=20\\ndown soon.=20\\n\"The market got set, and now we\\'re in trouble,\" Morris said. -- -- --=20\\nPG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim.=20\\nThe utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from=\\n=20\\n1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million=\\n=20\\nof that through customer rates.

The most=20\\nsignificant growth was experienced in southern states (excluding Florida).=\\n=20\\nThe second-largest growth in coal use was in the mid-central eastern states=\\n=20\\n(East Central Area Reliability Council or ECAR).=20\\n\\n\\n\\nBalanced portfolios?=20\\nCalifornia\\'s problems have vividly illustrated the value of a balanced=20\\nfuel-use portfolio for electric power generation. As of the close of 2000,=\\n=20\\nnationwide, coal dominates at 54%, followed by uranium at a distant second =\\nat=20\\n21%. Natural gas is gaining ground with 14% of the nation\\'s total fuel use=\\n=20\\nfor electricity generation.=20\\n\\n\\nRegionally, the distribution is much more variable. For example, about 37% =\\nof=20\\nthe fossil fuel consumed in the WSCC region for power generation was natura=\\nl=20\\ngas in 2000 compared to 29% in 1999. In absolute terms, several other regio=\\nns=20\\nconsume similar amounts of costly natural gas for power production. The NPP=\\nC=20\\nregion=01*New England including New York=01*relied on natural gas for about=\\n 40% of=20\\nits power generation in 2000 followed by SPP (primarily Oklahoma) with abou=\\nt=20\\n33%.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe distribution of fuel use is, in most cases, linked to available=20\\nresources. Given its proximity to natural gas reserves, for example, Texas=\\n=20\\nrelied on this fuel for a full 60% of its power generation in 2000, up from=\\n=20\\n55% in 1999. While less at risk for supply disruptions, a heavy dependence =\\non=20\\nnatural gas presents more exposure to its price volatility. On average, tot=\\nal=20\\nproduction costs for natural gas-fired generation topped $50 per MWh in 200=\\n0,=20\\nmaking it second to the total production costs for solar power.=20\\n\\n\\n\\nThere have been reports of potential coal shortages this summer, which coul=\\nd=20\\nimpact areas highly dependent on these sources, such as southern states, an=\\nd=20\\nthe mid-continent areas where power generation relies almost exclusively on=\\n=20\\ncoal. However, total production costs for coal generation, at under $20 per=\\n=20\\nMWh, remain substantially below all other fuel sources, except hydro.=20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNational Desk; Section A=20\\nBlackout Plans of Little Help In California\\'s Energy Crisis=20\\nBy JAMES STERNGOLD=20\\n?=20\\n05/14/2001=20\\nThe New York Times=20\\nPage 1, Column 1=20\\nc. 2001 New York Times Company=20\\nIRVINE, Calif., May 13 -- This spotless city of 148,000 people an hour\\'s=20\\ndrive south of Los Angeles is the largest planned community in the country,=\\n=20\\nwith a web of freeways feeding autos into neat patterns of eight-lane=20\\nboulevards that, on normal days, are almost a balletic composition in traff=\\nic=20\\nmanagement.=20\\nBut last week the picture was a little different. Irvine\\'s broad avenues ha=\\nd=20\\nbeen transformed into a knot of eight-lane parking lots by a rolling power=\\n=20\\nblackout, just the first of what experts predict will be dozens this summer=\\n=20\\nbecause of California\\'s power shortages. The hundreds of computer-operated=\\n=20\\ntraffic lights here were blank witnesses to the morass, as were the city\\'s=\\n=20\\npolice officers, who arrived at some major intersections only to watch=20\\nhelplessly until the electricity was switched back on an hour later.=20\\nCharles Brobeck, the chief of police, explained the one-sided arithmetic he=\\n=20\\nwas up against. Irvine has 279 signal intersections and only 160 officers o=\\nn=20\\nthe police force, with only a portion of them on duty at one time. As a=20\\nresult, he said, \\'\\'we\\'re too badly outnumbered to do much,\\'\\' in spite of=20\\nhundreds of hours spent planning for the blackouts.=20\\n\\'\\'When we get notice that these things are coming it\\'s like being told that=\\n=20\\nin 10 minutes there\\'s an asteroid that\\'s going to hit us,\\'\\' Chief Brobeck=\\n=20\\nsaid. \\'\\'We know it\\'s five million miles from earth, and it\\'s going to hit,=\\n=20\\nbut we\\'re not quite sure when or exactly where.\\'\\'=20\\nLast week gave just a hint of the improvisational tap dances local=20\\ngovernments are going to have to do all summer to cope with the rolling=20\\nblackouts. Municipalities across the state, the principal lines of defense=\\n=20\\nagainst chaos, have spent the last several months meticulously planning wha=\\nt=20\\nthey can plan. That has meant crash energy conservation programs and steps =\\nto=20\\nensure that critical services like the police and fire departments and=20\\ncomputer centers remain in operation at all times.=20\\nBut local officials said there was precious little their governments could =\\ndo=20\\nbeyond that during the predictably unpredictable but brief blackouts, usual=\\nly=20\\nan hour long.=20\\nSouthern California\\'s experience with earthquakes and wildfires has helped=\\n=20\\ninstill a sense of preparedness, but only to a degree. Because the=20\\npatchworklike blackouts are short-lived and require pinpoint actions rather=\\n=20\\nthan wide-scale mobilization, officials said, they are fundamentally more=\\n=20\\nchallenging.=20\\nThe incidents last week offered two perfect examples, said Ronald Mohr, an=\\n=20\\nenergy analyst with the Los Angeles County government.=20\\nOn Tuesday, he had just minutes\\' notice that blocks of the county\\'s power=\\n=20\\nsystem were about to be blacked out by the local utility, Southern Californ=\\nia=20\\nEdison, except he was not sure which blocks, or for precisely how long, or=\\n=20\\nexactly when it would happen.=20\\nHe had seconds to notify the most important of the county government\\'s 87,0=\\n00=20\\nemployees, but without using telephones, because that would take too long, =\\nas=20\\nhe had discovered on previous blackouts, and without sending too many e-mai=\\nl=20\\nmessages at once, because that would cause the system to crash.=20\\nAnd then there was Wednesday. Again, Mr. Mohr received notice of imminent=\\n=20\\nblackouts from Southern California Edison, bringing another round of franti=\\nc=20\\nmeasures, except this time it turned out to be a false alarm.=20\\n\\'\\'My entire life has been turned upside down,\\'\\' Mr. Mohr said. He explained=\\n=20\\nthat taking part in energy policy had been such a ponderously slow process =\\nin=20\\nthe past that it could take him four days to prepare a short letter.=20\\n\\'\\'We\\'ve been working 14-, 16-hour days.\\'\\' he said. \\'\\'My boss just missed hi=\\ns=20\\nanniversary. The main thing is that before, with emergency procedures, you=\\n=20\\nknew the rules. Everything was stable. You took a manual off a shelf. There=\\n=20\\nis no manual for a one-hour blackout.\\'\\'=20\\nTraffic may be the worst problem in the blackouts. For instance, in Ventura=\\n,=20\\njust north of here, the streets immediately came close to gridlock on=20\\nTuesday, and officials could only counsel patience.=20\\n\\'\\'We just leave the intersections dark,\\'\\' said Ronald Calkins, director of=\\n=20\\nthe city\\'s Department of Public Works. \\'\\'The motorists just have to know th=\\nat=20\\nthey are supposed to treat it as a four-way stop. We thought about using=20\\nportable stop signs, but it takes too long. By the time you get the stuff o=\\nut=20\\nthe lights are back on.\\'\\'=20\\nIn Irvine, there were three fender benders during Tuesday\\'s blackout; in=20\\nSanta Monica, one car was rammed so hard at an intersection that it flipped=\\n=20\\nover.=20\\nEileen Salmon, Irvine\\'s emergency coordinator, said the best that could be=\\n=20\\ndone, once care is taken to make sure essential services keep running, was =\\nto=20\\ncommunicate, but even doing that can be problematic. Ms. Salmon said that=\\n=20\\nlast Tuesday she received several false alarms before the blackouts, making=\\n=20\\nher responses something of a guessing game.=20\\nShe said most city operations were just told to wait out the blackouts.=20\\nSchools, she said, do nothing special; and city employees just take a break=\\n=20\\nfor the most part.=20\\nAllison Hart, the Irvine city manager, said the lack of specific advance=20\\ninformation from Southern California Edison was another problem.=20\\nThe utilities have said that they do not identify which areas will lose pow=\\ner=20\\nin advance because of concerns that criminals might take advantage of the=\\n=20\\nsituation by looting or breaking into buildings.=20\\n\\'\\'If you think the possibility of looting or something is worse than the=20\\ndevastating economic uncertainty of being hit by unpredictable rolling=20\\nblackouts in the sixth-largest economy in the world, I just think you\\'re=20\\nwrong,\\'\\' Ms. Hart said, adding that business groups have said they would=20\\nprefer more notice as well.=20\\nThe municipalities usually have backup diesel generators at critical sites,=\\n=20\\nbut even using those can pose difficulties. Many city officials said that a=\\ns=20\\nthey get warnings that power is running short, they are inclined to fire up=\\n=20\\ntheir generators early so that important facilities will never lose=20\\nelectricity.=20\\nBut state air quality rules restrict how long the cities can operate the=20\\ngenerators, usually to 200 hours a year. If the generators are left running=\\n=20\\nan hour or two every time there is a warning, as happened on Wednesday, the=\\n=20\\nofficials fear they will waste precious operating time.=20\\nMr. Mohr said that perhaps the greatest trial would be keeping municipal=20\\nemployees alert in a summer when emergency warnings would be the norm.=20\\nAlready, he said, officials are struggling against complacency.=20\\n\\'\\'Please don\\'t let a lazy or indifferent attitude develop due to the false=\\n=20\\npredictions,\\'\\' Mr. Mohr pleaded in a mass e-mail message sent after=20\\nWednesday\\'s near miss.=20\\nThen he added, \\'\\'This will be the last message tonight, unless conditions=\\n=20\\ndeteriorate.\\'\\'=20\\n\\nPhoto: Daniel Valenzuela and Carmen Kilsgaard waiting for power to be=20\\nrestored to Mario\\'s Mexican Restaurant in Huntington Beach, Calif.

Instead of the $8.9=\\n=20\\nbillion he wanted, Davis got a $716 million offer from generators -- and a=\\n=20\\nconclusion by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge who oversaw th=\\ne=20\\ntalks that California isn\\'t entitled to anything near $8.9 billion in=20\\nrefunds.=20\\nJudge Curtis Wagner plans to recommend that FERC hold a full hearing on the=\\n=20\\nstate\\'s refund claims but said he doubts the refunds would amount to more=\\n=20\\nthan $1 billion. That sum is so small that Wagner said the refunds would be=\\n=20\\ncanceled out by the unpaid debts owed to the generators.=20\\nState officials proclaimed the talks a victory of sorts. The governor\\'s chi=\\nef=20\\nnegotiator, Michael Kahn, said \"our positions were vindicated\" because=20\\ngenerators for the first time put refund dollars on the table.=20\\nThe governor says generators and marketers, in violation of a federal law=\\n=20\\nsetting a \"just and reasonable\" limit on wholesale electricity prices, have=\\n=20\\nroutinely overcharged California, plunging the state into a crisis that\\'s=\\n=20\\nbankrupted Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and could do the same to Southern=\\n=20\\nCalifornia Edison.=20\\nInsisting they\\'ve done nothing wrong, generators and marketers said they=20\\noffered the refunds simply to put the matter behind them.=20\\n\"It was to get rid of the litigation and investigations -- they\\'re a huge=\\n=20\\ndrag,\" said Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer. He wouldn\\'t say how much the=\\n=20\\nHouston-based marketer had offered.=20\\nPalmer and several experts said the state faces an uphill battle convincing=\\n=20\\nFERC that California is entitled to the mega-refund Davis wants.=20\\nFERC, which will make the final call on refunds, probably believes it\\'s=20\\nhelped California already by imposing price controls on wholesale=20\\nelectricity, and may not be inclined to order huge refunds, said Larry=20\\nFoster, editor of the Washington newsletter Inside FERC.=20\\n\"At some point the commission might say, \\'We\\'ve done all we can do (for=20\\nCalifornia), and if you don\\'t like it, go to court,\\' which is what the stat=\\ne=20\\nis going to do anyway,\" Foster said.=20\\nThe governor said Tuesday that he will sue FERC if it fails to order $8.9=\\n=20\\nbillion in refunds. \"You order what you think is fair,\" he said. \"We\\'ll tak=\\ne=20\\nwhat you order, and we\\'ll see you in court.\"=20\\nUndaunted by the threat, generators and marketers were chortling over remar=\\nks=20\\nby Wagner, who wrapped up the failed settlement talks by saying refunds=20\\nprobably wouldn\\'t top $1 billion.=20\\nCalifornians \"got hammered\" by Wagner, said Enron\\'s Palmer. \"The judge told=\\n=20\\nthem, \\'Look, your claim is bogus.\\'\"=20\\nWagner has retreated somewhat from his statement, telling the San Jose=20\\nMercury News that he isn\\'t sure what the final numbers would be.=20\\nSources have said that at one point in the talks, he suggested a $4.5 billi=\\non=20\\nrefund -- including $2 billion in cash and $2 billion in discounts on=20\\nlong-term power contracts. But it wasn\\'t clear how seriously anyone took th=\\nat=20\\nproposal, and as the talks wound down the judge was clearly dismissive of t=\\nhe=20\\nstate\\'s insistence on getting $8.9 billion.=20\\nExperts say FERC probably will hold the formal hearing and employ a formula=\\n=20\\nWagner recommended for calculating the refunds -- a formula that spells goo=\\nd=20\\nand bad news for both sides.=20\\nFor one thing, Wagner will likely urge a formula based on the price-control=\\n=20\\nsystem FERC implemented last month -- something that could work to=20\\nCalifornia\\'s advantage. The controls limit prices to a ceiling based on the=\\n=20\\nproduction costs of the least-efficient power generator in California.=20\\nBut Wagner\\'s plan would calculate production costs differently than FERC ha=\\ns=20\\nso far. He would employ a system that\\'s significantly more favorable to the=\\n=20\\ngenerators, said John Stout, senior vice president with power generator=20\\nReliant Energy Inc.=20\\nAlso, Wagner would ignore alleged overcharges prior to last October.

Just hours=\\n=20\\nearlier, Enron sued the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market=20\\nManipulation to stop the subpoena of its financial and electricity trading=\\n=20\\nrecords.  Enron attorney Michael Kirby said the company is prepared to turn=\\n=20\\nover 25,000 documents that were already in California, but that other=20\\ndocuments the committee wants are in Texas and out of the panel\\'s reach. =\\n=20\\nKirby filed 17 objections to the subpoena, including one that only the=20\\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate=20\\nwholesale markets. The committee voted to overrule most of the objections. =\\n=20\\nThe committee will prepare a report to the full Senate, recommending the=20\\ncompany be cited for contempt. If Enron turns over the records before the=\\n=20\\nSenate takes up the matter, the report will be shelved.  \"They\\'ve sent two=\\n=20\\nthings to Texas =01) our money and these documents, and they\\'re saying we c=\\nan\\'t=20\\nget either one back,\" said Laurence Drivon, special legal counsel to the=20\\nSenate committee.  The other subject of possible sanctions, Atlanta-based=\\n=20\\nMirant Inc., agreed to turn over subpoenaed documents.

The company and the committee=20\\nreached an agreement Tuesday night on the confidentiality concerns, Dorinso=\\nn=20\\nsaid.  Committee chairman Joe Dunn, a Santa Ana Democrat, said the=20\\ncommittee\\'s investigation will continue despite Enron\\'s \"pure act of=20\\nintimidation.

That shouldn\\'t matter, Drivon said, citing last year\\'s=\\n=20\\nsuccessful subpoena of out-of-state documents during the investigation into=\\n=20\\nthe activities of former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. Previous=\\n=20\\ninvestigations have included documents subpoenaed from other nations, he=20\\nsaid.  Companies doing business in California cannot claim immunity from it=\\ns=20\\nlaws or oversight, Drivon and Dunn said.

But Enron claimed that=\\n=20\\nthe committee had no authority to issue subpoenas outside California and th=\\nat=20\\nthe subpoenas themselves were flawed.\\n\\nThe company asked the court for an injunction against further investigation=\\n=20\\nby the committee and proposed that a \"neutral\" arbitrator or judge try to=\\n=20\\nfashion a compromise.\\n\\nDunn suggested that the lawsuit was an effort to intimidate the committee.=\\n=20\\nBut he insisted it \"will not impact our investigation.\"\\n\\nUnder contempt procedures, last used in 1929, the committee can find an=20\\nindividual or entity in contempt.

The=\\n=20\\npush to consolidate the operation of high-voltage transmission systems is a=\\nn=20\\nattempt to create a solid foundation for competitive power markets that hav=\\ne=20\\nbeen sullied by California \\'s market failure.=20\\nThe commission said it wants utilities and independent grid operators in th=\\ne=20\\nNortheast and Southeast regions to meet with FERC mediators within one week=\\n=20\\nand hammer out plans within 45 days to form two broad organizations to=20\\ncentrally manage power markets and energy flows in the East. The action=20\\nillustrates the FERC\\'s frustration with the slow pace of=20\\nelectric-transmission consolidation and is expected to be followed by simil=\\nar=20\\norders for the Midwest and the West.=20\\nThe federal orders are intended to accelerate development of=20\\nelectric-transmission organizations that the FERC endorsed in a landmark=20\\ndecision called Order 2000 issued in December 1999. In that order, the FERC=\\n=20\\nurged utilities to voluntarily surrender control of their transmission=20\\nsystems to grid organizations that would run daily markets for power and=20\\nmanage power flows across multiutility regions. The agency said consumers=\\n=20\\nwould benefit from larger, more efficient wholesale- electricity markets in=\\n=20\\nwhich transmission owners no longer would be able to give their own power=\\n=20\\nsales preferential access to the power-delivery system, snubbing lower-cost=\\n=20\\ncompetitors.=20\\nIn addition, formation of regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, wou=\\nld=20\\npropel \"postage stamp pricing\" for transmission services, FERC said, so=20\\nsuppliers could move power across vast distances for a single charge instea=\\nd=20\\nof incurring \"pancaked\" costs as power traversed separately operated system=\\ns.=20\\nCommissioner William Massey described yesterday\\'s directives as a \"watershe=\\nd\"=20\\nbecause \"never before have we been as explicit\" about the FERC\\'s resolve to=\\n=20\\nform big grid organizations \"that can\\'t be gerrymandered according to what=\\n=20\\nutilities want to do.\"=20\\nThe FERC orders likely will face resistance in the Southeast, where states=\\n=20\\nhaven\\'t deregulated their retail electricity markets and where fear of=20\\nfederal control is particularly acute. \"My guess is that those states will=\\n=20\\nsay, `We\\'re happy with what we\\'ve got and with keeping control over our own=\\n=20\\nutilities,\\'\" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor and power-markets=20\\nexpert at Stanford University. \"Any state that surrenders control to FERC,=\\n=20\\nafter what\\'s happened in California , isn\\'t thinking clearly.\"=20\\nThe directive also creates big problems for existing grid-running=20\\norganizations that thought they already were doing what the agency wanted.=\\n=20\\nCurrently, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states each are=20\\nrepresented by separate, nonprofit independent system operators, or ISOs,=\\n=20\\nthat operate transmission systems still owned by local utilities.

Such a virtua=\\nl=20\\nstructure would preserve the underlying organizations, each of which has it=\\ns=20\\nown control rooms, computer systems and governing boards.=20\\nCarol Murphy, spokeswoman for the New York ISO, said attempts to smooth out=\\n=20\\nmarket incongruities, or \"seams issues,\" likely will be halted now.

Gray Davis finally unveiled Monday what aides said was a=\\n=20\\ncomprehensive plan to shepherd California through the energy crisis.=20\\nThe thick compendium of charts, tables and narrative, prepared by a financi=\\nal=20\\nconsulting firm and peddled to legislators and journalists by a squad of=20\\nadministration aides, was designed to bolster Davis\\' case for legislative=\\n=20\\napproval of a $12.5 billion bond issue. About half the money would repay th=\\ne=20\\nstate\\'s beleaguered general fund, which has been drained for power purchase=\\ns,=20\\nand the rest would ease the impact on ratepayers\\' bills for future power=20\\npurchases.=20\\nAdministration officials insisted it is a realistic scheme based on=20\\nreasonable assumptions -- but legislators of both parties remained skeptica=\\nl=20\\nsince the governor\\'s previous assumptions and projections about the crisis=\\n=20\\nhad proved to be uniformly wrong. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether=\\n=20\\nthe bond issue bill that the administration says is vital will win=20\\nlegislative approval this week -- at least in the size Davis is seeking. Ev=\\nen=20\\nDemocrats are wary.=20\\nLegislative analysts zeroed in on a couple of assumptions that are central =\\nto=20\\nthe workability of the plan:=20\\nThat Californians will severely curtail their energy use this summer in=20\\nresponse to supply shortages, a big ad campaign and sharp price increases.=\\n=20\\nThat the state can buy spot market power this summer at rates far below wha=\\nt=20\\nit has been paying and what the power futures market indicates will be the=\\n=20\\nsummer spot price.=20\\nIf either of those two assumptions is off the mark, the state could face=20\\nsevere and prolonged blackouts and/or could go billions of dollars deeper=\\n=20\\ninto debt.=20\\nAdministration aides insisted that their assumptions are reasonable, based =\\non=20\\nwhat is known now about power consumption habits and the availability and=\\n=20\\nprice of power for the summer, when demand usually rises sharply to run air=\\n=20\\nconditioning.=20\\n\"This is not a guess,\" Susan Kennedy, a top Davis aide, told reporters in=\\n=20\\nresponse to sharp questioning about the plan\\'s projection of making spot=20\\nmarket power purchases during the summer at an average of $195 per=20\\nmegawatt-hour, 40 percent less than what the state is paying now. The curre=\\nnt=20\\nfutures market price for California-delivered power in July and August is=\\n=20\\nabout $500 per megawatt-hour, but administration officials insist they have=\\n=20\\ncontracted for much of the summer peak load at lower costs, leaving less=20\\nexposure to the spot market.=20\\nIf it all works as Davis hopes, customers of the three major utilities --=\\n=20\\nabout 70 percent of Californians -- will see a sharp boost in their rates=\\n=20\\nsoon, and that will be enough to finance the $20 billion in power purchase=\\n=20\\ndebts incurred by the utilities and the state so far, plus pay for future=\\n=20\\npurchases.=20\\nThe bonds would pick up the costs not covered by the raised rates in the=20\\nearly years of the scheme, then be paid off later as rates remain high but=\\n=20\\npower costs go down.

That\\'s significant becau=\\nse=20\\ndining out is one of the first luxuries people typically eliminate when tim=\\nes=20\\nget rough -- or even appear to be slowing down.=20\\nAt the same time, restaurant owners who say business is good remain anxious=\\n=20\\nabout the relentless energy crisis. They complain about big utility bills=\\n=20\\nthat promise to stay bloated through the summer and about higher operating=\\n=20\\ncosts from vendors now passing along their own inflated energy expenses.=20\\nThat all adds up to pricier menus.=20\\n\"I hoped not to increase prices, but there\\'s no slack when basic utilities=\\n=20\\nare so high now,\" said Barbara Mikacich, owner of Sacramento\\'s Andiamo=20\\nrestaurant, which expects to come out with a new menu in June.=20\\nWith a few exceptions, local bakery cafes, pizza shops, swanky steakhouses=\\n=20\\nand more are about to raise food prices while trying to cut back on energy=\\n=20\\nuse. Restaurants are taking such steps because they\\'re bracing for more=20\\nenergy problems and fear that the economic downturn -- while not obvious no=\\nw=20\\n-- could be around the corner.=20\\n\"We\\'re watching all the little things,\" said Mark Platt, operating partner =\\nat=20\\nP.F. Chang\\'s China Bistro in Roseville where sales are still strong. \"But=\\n=20\\nthere\\'s no dramatic way for us to save on our use of gas here. We have to u=\\nse=20\\nwoks.\"=20\\nNo menu price hikes or staff layoffs are in the wind at P.F. Chang\\'s, Platt=\\n=20\\nsaid. But the popular restaurant has changed some of its routine tasks to=\\n=20\\noffset gas and electric utility bills that have climbed from a combined=20\\n$12,500 a month when it opened in September to $16,000 now.=20\\nSo each morning, cooks at P.F. Chang\\'s no longer spend 20 minutes over=20\\ngas-fired flames removing carbon from the bottom of nine main woks. Now the=\\ny=20\\nget the job done in five minutes.=20\\nMeanwhile, the restaurant\\'s timers have been adjusted so that lights and ai=\\nr=20\\nconditioners turn on later in the day and shut off sooner.=20\\nElsewhere in Roseville, Carvers Steaks & Chops -- traditionally a lunchtime=\\n=20\\nhot spot with developers, bankers and other professionals -- stopped using=\\n=20\\nits five gas fireplaces.=20\\n\"We used to run them from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., six days a week,\" said genera=\\nl=20\\nmanager Gary Kowalsky. \"But we quit lighting them because they\\'re strictly=\\n=20\\nfor ambience.\"=20\\nPrompting that change is Carvers\\' combined utility bill. It used to run=20\\n$6,000 a month but has jumped to $10,000.=20\\nNo layoffs are planned at Carvers. Menu price hikes took effect six weeks a=\\ngo=20\\nwhen the restaurant added 50 cents to $1 to the prices for steak dishes.=20\\nAt Casey\\'s Bakery & Cafe on Sacramento\\'s Folsom Boulevard, the gas bill has=\\n=20\\ndoubled since February, said owner Casey Hayden. So instead of running=20\\nconvection ovens \"all day long,\" as he put it, the shop organizes jobs now =\\nso=20\\nthat more pastries and desserts bake at the same time, reducing use of the=\\n=20\\ncafe\\'s gas ovens.=20\\nIn mid-March, Casey\\'s reduced its operating hours from six days a week down=\\n=20\\nto just three, Friday through Sunday, in response to the energy crunch,=20\\nstagnant walk-in business during the week and an increase in wholesale=20\\naccounts.=20\\nSacramento\\'s Cafe Melange at 24th Street and Second Avenue also slashed hou=\\nrs=20\\ndue to higher utility costs, closing now at 7 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. Owner=\\n=20\\nMarrie Morris said she may raise prices in the next month or two.=20\\nHeating and cooling the large warehouse environment of Fox & Goose Public=\\n=20\\nHouse on R Street has always been challenging. But now the midtown restaura=\\nnt=20\\nis facing a Pacific Gas and Electric bill that topped $1,200 in March -- or=\\n=20\\ndouble the amount from a year earlier.=20\\nThat strain on top of higher produce, dairy and labor costs has prompted Fo=\\nx=20\\n& Goose to print a new menu due out in June. It will include some of the mo=\\nst=20\\npopular items from the now-closed Greta\\'s Cafe -- previously operated by Fo=\\nx=20\\n& Goose owner Allyson Dalton -- and several higher priced items.=20\\n\"About 50 percent of the menu is going up, but nominally, 2 to 3 percent,\"=\\n=20\\nsaid Dalton.=20\\nSacramento\\'s Original Pete\\'s pizza chain, which is slated to open a Davis=\\n=20\\noutlet, its sixth, this week, cut off its janitorial service. The cleaning=\\n=20\\nduties will be handled by staffers. The restaurant also turned off many=20\\nlights and now runs just one oven instead of two during slow times. It, too=\\n,=20\\nplans to raise menu prices soon.=20\\n\"We will take a very modest increase across the board, about 3 percent,\" sa=\\nid=20\\nfounder Steve Presson, who also noted \"early warning signs\" of an economic=\\n=20\\nslowdown, including more customers writing bad checks, credit card numbers=\\n=20\\nbeing denied and the use of fraudulent cards.=20\\nNow with the threat of rolling summer blackouts, restaurateurs are even=20\\nedgier because such power outages might discourage dining out, typically mo=\\nre=20\\npopular during warm weather and extra daylight hours.=20\\nA blackout at Carvers, the Roseville steakhouse, for example, would mean a=\\n=20\\nshutdown of its gas valves and computer-operated cash register system, said=\\n=20\\nmanager Kowalsky.=20\\n\"I hope there\\'s some resolution to all of this,\" he said. \"I can\\'t imagine=\\n=20\\nanything worse than a building full of hungry people who you can\\'t serve.\"\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n------------------------\\nBee Editorial\\nEmpowering the public\\nObstacles keep cities out of energy\\n\\n\\n(Published April 30, 2001)\\n\\nIn a city the size of Davis, how many citizens does it take to kill an=20\\ninitiative to create a public power agency and remove PG&E as the supplier =\\nof=20\\nelectricity? Only three. That\\'s because, under state law, a five-member=20\\ngovernment agency, the county Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO),=20\\nwhich operates largely in obscurity, can reject the proposal before it even=\\n=20\\ngets to the ballot box.=20\\nOver the past several decades, laws such as this have made it harder for=20\\ncommunities to leave the domain of the investor-owned utilities and turn=20\\npower into a public enterprise. Sacramento\\'s long struggle to create its=20\\nmunicipal utility district (SMUD) began in the 1920s. It took two decades o=\\nf=20\\nfighting a resistant PG&E for SMUD to get into the distribution business. I=\\nf=20\\ntoday\\'s laws were in effect back then, Sacramentans might still be fighting=\\n,=20\\nor have given up long ago.=20\\nAmid the pile of energy-related legislation in the capitol is one that seek=\\ns=20\\nto remove these roadblocks to public power. At the heart of SB 23x by Sens.=\\n=20\\nNell Soto of Pomona and John Burton of San Francisco are two valuable=20\\nreforms. If the private utilities don\\'t manage to kill this bill, the futur=\\ne=20\\nwill provide interesting choices for communities that are beginning to asse=\\nss=20\\ntheir energy options.=20\\nThe first reform in SB 23x would be to prevent LAFCOs from blocking electio=\\nns=20\\nto decide whether to create a public power agency. LAFCOs now hold this vet=\\no=20\\npower. This is how residents in and around the city of Davis were prevented=\\n=20\\nlast year from voting on a public power initiative on the ballot. They had=\\n=20\\nthousands of signatures on their initiative petitions. But they didn\\'t have=\\n=20\\nthree votes on LAFCO. SB 23x would give LAFCO an advisory role, so that=20\\nvoters can take their findings into consideration.=20\\nThe second reform would change what happens when a newly formed public powe=\\nr=20\\nagency decides to purchase the local electric distribution lines from PG&E.=\\n A=20\\nlaw passed in the early 1990s gave PG&E considerable leverage in court to=\\n=20\\nchallenge whether it\\'s necessary for the municipal utility to buy its wires=\\n.=20\\nPG&E seeks to substitute its will for that of the voters. SB 23x returns to=\\n=20\\nthe municipal utility the legal presumption that it can take over the lines=\\n,=20\\nleaving the courts to settle on the appropriate price. This is the proper=\\n=20\\nrole of the courts.=20\\nA new municipal utility doesn\\'t necessarily have to buy the lines and get=\\n=20\\ninto the distribution business. It may simply buy power in bulk and pass on=\\n=20\\nthe savings to its citizens. The first step is for communities to assess=20\\ntheir options. Davis residents are once again mulling secession from PG&E, =\\nas=20\\nare activists in Fresno, communities within Orange County and San Francisco=\\n.=20\\nIt\\'s too soon to say whether these seeds of a modern-day public power=20\\nmovement ultimately come to fruition. Yet the mere threat of secession acts=\\n=20\\nas an appropriate check against the investor-owned utilities. Communities a=\\nre=20\\nnot their hostages.

But=\\n=20\\nGolden Staters from Gov. Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma=\\n=20\\nresident. He might be the man who saves our future.=20\\nBailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary cap=\\ns=20\\non the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall=20\\n2002, when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might=20\\nreturn to the West\\'s energy market.=20\\nHis rationale is this: To save California\\'s private electricity market, new=\\n=20\\npower plants are desperately needed. But not enough of those plants will be=\\n=20\\nbuilt if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product the=\\ny=20\\nalready are providing.=20\\nCalifornians, though, don\\'t want to promise payment without knowing they wi=\\nll=20\\nbe able to afford the bill. Short-term caps on profits, Bailey believes, ar=\\ne=20\\nthe best way to ease the state\\'s fears, get everybody paid and move on to a=\\n=20\\nsystem that works -- for suppliers and customers.=20\\n\"One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create somethin=\\ng=20\\nthat California can look at and say, \\'So long as prices are determined on=\\n=20\\nthis basis, we\\'re prepared to pay,\\' \" Bailey said in an interview. \"This is=\\n a=20\\nmechanism that lets the state say, \\'We\\'re not signing a blank check. We don=\\n\\'t=20\\nknow what the price is going to be, but we do know how it will be=20\\ndetermined.\\' \"=20\\nBailey\\'s proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last we=\\nek=20\\nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and far better for Californi=\\na.=20\\nThe federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached, would kick =\\nin=20\\nonly during emergencies and would be focused on prices, not profits. Bailey=\\n=20\\nis proposing that all power sold from now through summer 2002 be priced at=\\n=20\\nthe cost of producing it, plus a profit of 15 percent. That\\'s more than a=\\n=20\\nregulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek, and=\\n=20\\nfar less than electricity providers have been earning of late.=20\\nCynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has=\\n=20\\nsqueezed all it can from California. The firm reported last week that profi=\\nts=20\\ndoubled in the first quarter of 2001 over a year ago, with pretax income fr=\\nom=20\\nits energy services nearly tripling, to $600 million. Much of the 4,000=20\\nmegawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already=20\\ncommitted in long-term contracts -- so Bailey has relatively little to lose=\\n=20\\nif what remains can only be sold at controlled prices.=20\\nBut here is at least one measure of Bailey\\'s sincerity: His company still i=\\ns=20\\nowed $252 million for electricity it has provided California. And he\\'s not=\\n=20\\ninsisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect=\\n,=20\\nor even as part of the deal.=20\\n\"Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with,\" he said. \"Whether that=\\n=20\\nultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the=20\\nparties, it will sort itself out one way or another. Perhaps if we find=20\\nprices that work going forward, that could be used as a framework.\"=20\\nBailey, an engineer by training, says no one should mistake his proposal fo=\\nr=20\\na lack of confidence in free markets. He still firmly believes that a=20\\nderegulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the=\\n=20\\nWest in the long term. He just wants to make sure there is a long term.=20\\nBailey is watching, and listening, to California. He hears talk of seizing=\\n=20\\npower plants, of turning to a public power system. He describes these ideas=\\n=20\\nas Draconian and says they would not solve the problem. But he also knows=\\n=20\\nthere is a limit to what Californians -- and their elected leaders -- can=\\n=20\\ntake.=20\\n\"I recognize we live in a democracy, and lots of things could happen,\" he=\\n=20\\nsaid.=20\\nWhat he is proposing, in effect, is a safety valve. He wants to limit the=\\n=20\\nmarket in order to save it.=20\\n\"This is an extraordinary situation,\" Bailey said. \"We need to help create=\\n=20\\nsome breathing room. ...

Or from a gang of criminals, corporate polluters, corrupt governme=\\nnt=20\\nofficials or aliens from Mars.=20\\nOut of nowhere, someone - sometimes from the least expected place - steps t=\\no=20\\nthe plate. It\\'s not just in the movies. History books are filled with the=\\n=20\\nlikes of George Washington, Winston Churchill, Lech Walesa. People who seiz=\\ned=20\\nthe moment and made it their own; people who chose to lead - and worry abou=\\nt=20\\nthe consequences later.\\nHistory books are filled, also, with those who ducked for cover, pointed=20\\nfingers or ran away.\\nNo one would have believed it, but in spring 2001 the nation\\'s most populou=\\ns=20\\nstate is struggling with looming blackouts, soaring electricity rates, stat=\\ne=20\\nlegislators blustering about Evil Power Producers and proposing \"solutions\"=\\n=20\\nthat lost credence when the Berlin Wall fell. And rather than lead, the man=\\n=20\\non the hot seat has become angry, immobile. He stands there, yelling \"It\\'s=\\n=20\\nnot my fault,\" and waiting for the mess to evaporate.\\nMost Californians sympathize with Gov. Gray Davis, who just a few months ag=\\no=20\\nwas viewed as an inevitable presidential contender. We know he didn\\'t creat=\\ne=20\\nthe current mess.\\nBut it\\'s Davis\\' moment, nonetheless. One would have thought the man who spe=\\nnt=20\\nhis career plotting his rise to the governor\\'s office would have had some=\\n=20\\nunderlying reason for aspiring to the post. Anyone can be a leader when=20\\nthere\\'s nothing to do but spend a surplus. But the real test comes when the=\\n=20\\nchips are down.\\nNo one should pin their hopes on politicians. Typically, pols should tend t=\\no=20\\nthe administrative affairs of government and let a free people live free=20\\nlives. But the electricity imbroglio is a government-created mess that=20\\ninitially requires a government solution.\\nAfter all, we\\'re talking about highly regulated utilities. It is a botched=\\n=20\\nstate de-regulation plan - actually a re-regulation plan - that exacerbated=\\n=20\\nthe energy problems. And it has been the state\\'s unwillingness to allow pow=\\ner=20\\ngenerators to build plants that has added to supply shortfalls.\\nThere are two directions to choose: Toward a system owned and operated by t=\\nhe=20\\nstate government, or toward a market-based system that treats electricity=\\n=20\\nlike any other commodity. The price of natural gas, food, clothing and othe=\\nr=20\\nessentials are allowed to rise and fall, according to the marketplace.\\nWhy is electricity so holy?\\nIf prices are allowed to float, and generators are allowed to provide the=\\n=20\\njuice to fill demand, soon enough a competitive market will overtake the=20\\ninitial price jumps and force prices down again. Sen. Tom McClintock,=20\\nR-Thousand Oaks, one of the few rational voices in Sacramento, argues that=\\n=20\\nDavis should have returned the surplus to taxpayers, who would have then ha=\\nd=20\\nthe means to pay for the initial price spikes.\\nInstead, Davis has spent the surplus buying electricity, allowing taxpayers=\\n=20\\nto foot the bill because he refuses to allow customers (Aren\\'t they the sam=\\ne=20\\npeople?) to pay market prices. Adding insult to injury, he refuses to make=\\n=20\\nhis dealings public.\\nFurthermore, Davis could have stabilized the situation last year when leade=\\nrs=20\\nof the state\\'s utilities tried in vain to get his attention about looming=\\n=20\\nproblems and to urge limited price increases and use of long-term contracts=\\n=20\\nto buy power. Instead, Davis and his handpicked political crony who runs th=\\ne=20\\nPublic Utilities Commission did nothing - except let a problem spiral into =\\na=20\\nfull-blown crisis.=20\\nWithout any leadership from the top, Californians hear a cacophony of=20\\nproposals from below.\\nThe Legislature, dominated by Democrats far out on the \"left-wing yahoo\"=20\\nscale, are talking about Texas power generators in the same overheated=20\\nrhetoric some right-wingers use to talk about the Chinese communists. One=\\n=20\\ntalked about sending tanks to Houston.\\nUnderstandably, the utility companies are looking out for their own=20\\ninterests.=20\\nPacific Gas & Electric, angry that the governor refused to do anything abou=\\nt=20\\nthe crisis, declared bankruptcy the day after Davis\\' say-nothing address to=\\n=20\\nCalifornians this month. As some commentators note, PG&E is far more=20\\ncomfortable dealing with a bankruptcy judge than dealing with a governor an=\\nd=20\\nlegislators who starred in \"Clueless in Sacramento.\"\\nBy contrast, Southern California Edison has chosen not to file bankruptcy=\\n=20\\nnow, preferring instead to sell the state its transmission lines as a way t=\\no=20\\ngenerate cash to keep this quasi-private entity going.=20\\nJohn Bryson, a longtime Davis associate and a creature of the=20\\ngovernment/regulatory/utility model, frankly admits that the main rationale=\\n=20\\nfor selling the lines to the state is to keep his company afloat, independe=\\nnt=20\\nand credit worthy.\\nBut it\\'s a lousy idea for taxpayers, who would gain a multibillion-dollar=\\n=20\\nliability badly in need of costly maintenance. I don\\'t blame Bryson (who, b=\\ny=20\\nthe way, co-founded the left-wing Natural Resources Defense Council early i=\\nn=20\\nhis career) for looking out for his company first. But what\\'s good for the=\\n=20\\nutilities is not necessarily good for taxpayers.\\nThen there are the self-proclaimed consumer advocates.

Charging whatever California\\'s dysfunctional pow=\\ner=20\\nmarket will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have creat=\\ned=20\\na kind of Kuwait along the Columbia.=20\\nWith their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness o=\\nf=20\\nEastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make stil=\\nl=20\\nmore power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders -- whi=\\nle=20\\nmaking sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North=\\n=20\\nAmerica. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utilit=\\ny=20\\nluxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1.6=\\n=20\\nmillion customers.=20\\nTheir good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may=\\n=20\\nwell be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the=\\n=20\\nregion. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power a=\\nnd=20\\nmay be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall.=20\\n\\'\\'This is not nice money,\\'\\' said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a=\\n=20\\ngroup that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. \\'\\'It is something tha=\\nt=20\\nis offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their=20\\nair-conditioners.\\'\\'=20\\nNice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.=20\\nNorth of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility=\\n=20\\nthat has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year=\\n=20\\nthan it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last=\\n=20\\nyear had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000=\\n=20\\neach, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less tha=\\nn=20\\n$25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders\\' names for fear=\\n=20\\ntheir children might be kidnapped.=20\\nThe chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District=20\\nacknowledged that increases in the cost of power were \\'\\'huge\\'\\' and=20\\n\\'\\'obscene.\\'\\' But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, \\'\\'We would be=20\\nimprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.\\'\\'=20\\nNext door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns t=\\nwo=20\\ndams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It had=\\n a=20\\nrecord $88.8 million in profits last year -- more than double its best=20\\nprevious year.=20\\nGrant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customer=\\ns,=20\\nis using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for=\\n=20\\nlocal residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against=\\n=20\\npower shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility=\\n=20\\nestimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the=20\\ncoming year.=20\\nLike Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to=\\n=20\\ninsulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as no=\\nw,=20\\nlocal needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant a=\\nnd=20\\nChelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.=20\\nGrant County\\'s utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving=\\n a=20\\nshare of its profits to its customers.=20\\n\\'\\'How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people=\\n=20\\nare paying more for electricity?\\'\\' asked Lon Topaz, director of resource=20\\nmanagement for the utility. \\'\\'It would be lousy politics.\\'\\'=20\\nAn Upside-Down Economy=20\\nThe second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined=\\n=20\\nwith California\\'s deregulation mess to further distort the energy market.=\\n=20\\nDrought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be=\\n=20\\nsold on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year\\'s price -- i=\\nt=20\\nhas strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every=\\n=20\\nmegawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in,=20\\nlong-term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sen=\\nt=20\\nsouth to California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings=\\n=20\\nand a long-distance bonanza.=20\\nAs a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower=\\n=20\\nhas been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $4=\\n40=20\\nan acre not to farm.=20\\nSimilarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year b=\\ny=20\\nnot making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight=\\n=20\\nWall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by=20\\nreselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990\\'s under a cheap=20\\nlong-term contract.=20\\nEven residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars=\\n=20\\nfrom the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its=\\n=20\\ncustomers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not us=\\ne,=20\\nif their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year\\'s level.=20\\nFor utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California\\'=\\ns=20\\nelectricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of priva=\\nte=20\\nAmerican utilities have also benefited from California\\'s troubles.=20\\nBC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and=\\n=20\\nPeace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to=20\\nexceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 millio=\\nn=20\\nin United States currency).=20\\nTo celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it=\\n=20\\nhad never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for=\\n=20\\n$130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, whic=\\nh=20\\nhave not gone up for seven years.=20\\n\\'\\'We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were=\\n=20\\nbuilt by people of great foresight,\\'\\' said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of B=\\nC=20\\nHydro.=20\\nWhen reminded that a March study by the California Independent System=20\\nOperator, which runs that state\\'s power grid, accused BC Hydro of market=20\\nmanipulation and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy.=20\\n\\'\\'All they do is scream and shout and they won\\'t pay you the money they owe=\\n=20\\nyou,\\'\\' he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help=20\\nCalifornia in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said,=\\n=20\\nadding that it was California\\'s \\'\\'awful mess\\'\\' in deregulating power market=\\ns=20\\nthat fueled BC Hydro\\'s record profits.=20\\nA Good Deal for Farmers=20\\nIn the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the=\\n=20\\nColumbia from the world\\'s premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable=\\n=20\\nlakes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a thi=\\nrd=20\\nof America\\'s hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in t=\\nhe=20\\nNorthwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-voltage=\\n=20\\ntransmission lines did not exist.=20\\nThe main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in=\\n=20\\nthe 1930\\'s, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam i=\\nn=20\\nNorth America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily=20\\ndesigned as a water-delivery device for farmers.=20\\nSince then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to=20\\nshuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columb=\\nia=20\\nBasin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in=\\n=20\\nfederal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation,=\\n=20\\nwhich built it.=20\\nIn addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia=\\n=20\\nand the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out=\\n=20\\nof the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently=20\\nsells for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin=\\n=20\\nhistorian, has written, farmers here have always felt that \\'\\'no price is to=\\no=20\\nhigh to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill.\\'\\'=\\n=20\\nThis year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the=20\\nBonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricit=\\ny=20\\nfrom 29 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could=20\\npersuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water=\\n=20\\nleft in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 millio=\\nn=20\\n(if it had to be purchased at current market prices).=20\\nIn a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville =\\nis=20\\npaying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for eac=\\nh=20\\nacre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County\\'s public utility is=20\\npaying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land.=\\n=20\\nOn April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe=\\n=20\\nhere in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year,=\\n=20\\nthey agreed that it was a good deal.=20\\nStill, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies=\\n=20\\nthat keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the=20\\nprecedent they set when they traded water for cash.=20\\n\\'\\'This has to be a temporary deal,\\'\\' said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms=\\n=20\\n900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout.=\\n=20\\n\\'\\'If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be n=\\no=20\\ntakers.\\'\\'=20\\nSeveral farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t=\\nhe=20\\nlifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were=20\\ninterviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their=\\n=20\\ntable.=20\\n\\'\\'We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full,\\'\\' sai=\\nd=20\\nTricia C. Lubach, a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation=20\\nfarmer. \\'\\'Not too long ago they didn\\'t worry about where the power comes=20\\nfrom. Someday they may think about where the food comes from.\\'\\'=20\\nA \\'Wonderful Energy Fit\\'=20\\nA couple of hundred miles northwest of George, in a penthouse conference ro=\\nom=20\\nthat overlooks Vancouver harbor, Mr. Smith, the chairman of British=20\\nColumbia\\'s most profitable company, explained in mid-April what a pain it w=\\nas=20\\nselling electricity to Californians.=20\\n\\'\\'People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful=20\\nCalifornians,\\'\\' he said. It does not help, he added, that the state is behi=\\nnd=20\\non its bills by about $300 million.=20\\nStill, neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose=20\\nCalifornia\\'s money. The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial=20\\nbudget, which in the last decade has received more than $3.7 billion from B=\\nC=20\\nHydro.=20\\n\\'\\'We have a wonderful energy fit,\\'\\' Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro\\'s=\\n=20\\npower-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians=20\\nthemselves. \\'\\'We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high=20\\ndemand, and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff =\\nto=20\\ngive to us.\\'\\'=20\\nBC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell=20\\npower when it is most needed -- and most expensive -- in California. The=20\\nutility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing=\\n=20\\nwater while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power broug=\\nht=20\\nfrom across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucet=\\ns=20\\nand zaps electricity off to California.=20\\n\\'\\'We spill water during the day,\\'\\' Mr. Smith said. \\'\\'Why? Is it because we=\\n=20\\ncan make more money? No. It\\'s because that is when everybody wants=20\\nelectricity, for God\\'s sake.\\'\\'=20\\nQuestions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in th=\\ne=20\\nNorthwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff s=\\no=20\\nfar this year to about half of what is considered normal.=20\\nThe shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plant=\\ns=20\\nand a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and=20\\ncapacity to generate it.=20\\n\\'\\'Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at=20\\nquadrupling of the power rates,\\'\\' said Paul Norman, head of power operation=\\ns=20\\nat Bonneville.=20\\nUnless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that =\\nby=20\\nlate summer, the Northwest\\'s era of cheap power could come to a sudden and=\\n=20\\npainfully expensive end.=20\\n\\nPhoto: Electricity generated by Rock Island Dam in Chelan County, Wash.,=20\\nhelped the county\\'s public utility earn a record $58.2 million in profits=\\n=20\\nlast year.

He said it would=\\n=20\\nrecommend \"a mix of new legislation, some executive action as well as priva=\\nte=20\\ninitiatives\" to bolster energy production.=20\\nBut he made clear that the administration will base its policy on promoting=\\n a=20\\nvigorous expansion of the traditional energy industry and will avoid the=20\\nkinds of austerity measures that marked the country\\'s response to the energ=\\ny=20\\ncrisis in the 1970s.=20\\n\"To speak exclusively of conservation is to duck the tough issues,\" Cheney=\\n=20\\nsaid. \"Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a=20\\nsufficient basis -- all by itself -- for a sound, comprehensive energy=20\\npolicy.\"=20\\nCheney said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power may=20\\nprovide an important part of the country\\'s energy strategy in the years to=\\n=20\\ncome but that it is premature to rely on them now. \"Years down the road,=20\\nalternative fuels may become a great deal more plentiful,\" he said. \"But we=\\n=20\\nare not yet in any position to stake our economy and our own way of life on=\\n=20\\nthat possibility.\"=20\\nBush promised during last year\\'s campaign to develop a muscular national=20\\nenergy strategy, and named Cheney to head the task force less than two week=\\ns=20\\nafter taking office. Various sectors of the energy industry have billions o=\\nf=20\\ndollars riding on the outcome of the administration\\'s policy review.=20\\nCheney said the plan will call for increased exploration for new sources of=\\n=20\\noil, coal and natural gas, and construction of refineries, plants and=20\\npipelines. He reiterated the administration\\'s support for drilling in=20\\nAlaska\\'s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which he said could be tapped for=\\n=20\\noil without disrupting its environment.=20\\nCheney, who was chairman of the oil services firm Halliburton Co. before=20\\ntaking office, called coal \"the most plentiful source of affordable energy =\\nin=20\\nthe country\" and said it will remain the nation\\'s primary source of=20\\nelectricity for years.=20\\n\"Coal is not the cleanest source of energy,\" Cheney said, \"and we must=20\\nsupport efforts to improve clean-coal technology to soften its impact on th=\\ne=20\\nenvironment.\"=20\\nThe vice president called nuclear power one of \"the cleanest methods of pow=\\ner=20\\ngeneration that we know.\"=20\\n\"But the government has not granted a single new nuclear power permit in mo=\\nre=20\\nthan 20 years,\" Cheney said. \"If we\\'re serious about environmental=20\\nprotection, then we must seriously question the wisdom of backing away from=\\n=20\\nwhat is, as a matter of record, a safe, clean and very plentiful energy=20\\nsource.\"=20\\nOfficials with the coal and nuclear power industries, which have had little=\\n=20\\nto celebrate in recent years, welcomed Cheney\\'s remarks.=20\\n\"Bless his heart,\" said Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal=20\\nAssociation. \"We have been something of the whipping child for some time no=\\nw.=20\\nThis is kind of like your dad when he compliments you when you were growing=\\n=20\\nup. We\\'ve got people in Washington talking to us now.\"=20\\nSteve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, said it was=20\\n\"heartening to see that the administration is not only recognizing but=20\\npublicly acknowledging the positive role that nuclear energy plays in a=20\\ndiverse portfolio of energy sources.\"=20\\nSeveral environmental groups said the policy outlined by Cheney could negat=\\ne=20\\nwhatever good will the administration had gained with its recent spate of=\\n=20\\nenvironmentally friendly announcements. Philip E. Clapp, president of the=\\n=20\\nNational Environmental Trust, called Cheney\\'s prescription \"an=20\\nacross-the-board attack on the environment.\"=20\\nLois Corbett, executive director of the Toronto Energy Alliance, said: \"I\\'d=\\n=20\\nhate to think we\\'ll have to throw up a huge iron curtain to keep American=\\n=20\\nsmog and acid rain on the American side. Clean-coal technology is an=20\\noxymoron. It\\'s a dirty fuel.\"=20\\nRaney and other coal industry officials were summoned to an administration=\\n=20\\nbriefing last week in which Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and other=20\\nadministration officials promised that coal would be a key part of the ener=\\ngy=20\\npolicy.=20\\nAttendees said that although no specifics were discussed about tax breaks o=\\nr=20\\nrelaxed regulations, they were assured the administration would work for a=\\n=20\\nmore stable and predictable process of getting permits to build or renovate=\\n=20\\ncoal-fired generating plants.=20\\nAdministration officials said Bush\\'s budget includes $150 million for=20\\ndeveloping clean-coal technology, new methods for converting coal to energy=\\n=20\\nthat result in less pollution. Cheney called conservation \"an important par=\\nt=20\\nof the total effort.\"=20\\n\\nContact: http://www.washingtonpost.com=20\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nWestern Dreaming -- a buyer\\'s cartel 5/1/01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Kathleen McFall\\nkmcfall@ftenergy.com\\nIn California, the cost of electricity was $7 billion in 1999, $32 billion=\\n=20\\nlast year, and if expectations hold true, will rise to $65 billion this yea=\\nr,=20\\nsaid California Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently. As a consequence of this=20\\nescalation, the pressure is mounting on state and federal legislators to=20\\nsolve the California crisis=01*or to find someone else to blame it on. It\\'s=\\n=20\\nincreasingly looking like political suicide to do nothing.\\n\\nInitiatives and insults are flying, and the only consensus in this=20\\npolitically charged debate is that Western states are facing a grim summer,=\\n=20\\nand merchant power companies=01*an easy target=01*are somehow fleecing Cali=\\nfornia.\\n\\nIn this atmosphere, an interesting, albeit fringe, idea was recently posed =\\nin=20\\na report by economist Peter Navarro of the University of California-Irvine=\\n=20\\nand Michael Shames of the San Diego-based consumer group the Utility=20\\nConsumers\\' Action Network (UCAN).\\n\\n\"California should join with Oregon and Washington to create a buyers\\' cart=\\nel=20\\nto offset the market power of the Western generators. This multistate buyer=\\ns\\'=20\\ncartel should offer to pay a reasonable price for power to the sellers\\'=20\\ncartel members=01*but not a penny more,\" said the report.\\n\\nThe report named Mirant, Enron, Dynegy, Reliant and Williams Cos. as member=\\ns=20\\nof a \"sellers\\' cartel.\"\\n\\nWhile the idea may be organizationally untenable, it nevertheless places th=\\ne=20\\nCalifornia situation in an interesting conceptual framework, given the=20\\npoliticization of the crisis. It\\'s certainly an approach many politicians=\\n=20\\nwould rally around if they could figure out a way to use it to reduce OPEC\\'=\\ns=20\\nmarket influence.\\n\\nThe buyers\\' cartel\\nShames, a consumer advocate, gained notoriety as the author of a 1999 paper=\\n=20\\n(posted on UCAN\\'s Web site) that predicted today\\'s energy crisis. He said t=\\nhe=20\\nidea has garnered a positive response, in some circles.\\n\\n\"Surprisingly so,\" Shames said. \"Supportive sentiments have been echoed by=\\n=20\\nthe head of DWR [California Department of Water Resources] and a number of=\\n=20\\neconomists including Paul Krugman in a New York Times op-ed piece.\" Accordi=\\nng=20\\nto Shames, the recent Senate Bill SBX-73 introduced in California embodies=\\n=20\\nthe critical elements of the cartel approach.\\n\\nUCAN proposes the approach only as a backup plan in the event that the=20\\nWestern situation turns catastrophic this summer. \"One could view it as an=\\n=20\\ninsurance policy; it would not need to be used unless the governor\\'s summer=\\n=20\\nstrategy begins to falter. It contains two elements: creation of a hard-nos=\\ned=20\\n\\'buyers\\' cartel\\' and, if necessary, the forced sale of in-state generation=\\n=20\\nplants to the state,\" said the report.\\n\\nEach day, a Western states buyers\\' cooperative would set a price it conside=\\nrs=20\\nfair and reasonable, based on the cost of producing electricity, natural ga=\\ns=20\\nprices or other fuels, and a generous double-digit profit margin in order t=\\no=20\\nensure future investment in the power infrastructure.\\n\\nA power plant operator that wanted to sell electricity in these three Pacif=\\nic=20\\nCoast states would meet the price set by the cooperative. Those who didn\\'t=\\n=20\\nlike the price could shut down their plants and sit out the market for the=\\n=20\\nday, said Shames and Navarro.\\n\\nFor this plan to be effective, the report\\'s authors concede California\\'s=20\\nlegislature would have to pass emergency legislation to modify current law=\\n=20\\nrequiring California\\'s independent system operator to purchase power \"at an=\\ny=20\\nprice\" to keep the lights on.\\n\\n\"This will empower the buyer\\'s cartel to enforce its fair price offer,\" sai=\\nd=20\\nthe report. It would also hold consumers hostage to a battle between cartel=\\ns.\\n\\nBlackouts as leverage\\n\"The formation of a buyers\\' cartel will almost certainly spark retaliatory=\\n=20\\nblackouts as the sellers\\' cartel tests the political will of our legislator=\\ns=20\\nand governor. Indeed, the bold measures proposed here will require politica=\\nl=20\\nfortitude,\" the report asserts.\\n\\nTo respond to this eventuality, instead of random rolling blackouts sweepin=\\ng=20\\nthe state without notice, rotating outages would be planned and telegraphed=\\n=20\\nahead of time. \"That would give predictability to business and residents,=\\n=20\\nwhich is what most people want. It also would tip off the crooks, of course=\\n,=20\\nwho might prey on homes suddenly left without alarms. But the cops,=20\\nforewarned as well, could mobilize ahead of them with extra patrols,\"=20\\nsuggests the report.\\n\\nThe authors believe calling the bluff once or twice would be enough to brin=\\ng=20\\ncosts down to reasonable levels and break the \"seller\" cartel\\'s market grip=\\n.\\n\\nMerchant power companies would have to answer both to stockholders and the=\\n=20\\noutrage of public opinion if plants were intentionally idled during a=20\\nblackout. Blackouts appear to be inevitable this summer due to genuine powe=\\nr=20\\nshortages, but this approach would at least contain the price of available=\\n=20\\npower according to the logic of the report. The authors say that it\\'s \"a pl=\\nan=20\\nthat a free-market economist could love. Buyers pooling their clout to win =\\na=20\\nbetter price. People sacrificing to get what they want. Generators free to=\\n=20\\nparticipate, or not.\"\\n\\nIf the blackouts grew too disruptive, Shames and Navarro said, Gov. Gray=20\\nDavis and his counterparts in Oregon and Washington would have to use=20\\nemergency powers to seize the plants that refuse to play the game. That\\'s=\\n=20\\nwhen things would get ugly.\\n\\nBunker mentality\\nThe Shames and Navarro proposal has, at its core, a presumption of unfair=\\n=20\\npractices by merchant power, something these companies and other economists=\\n=20\\nwould certainly refute. Ironically, this cartel approach could work in favo=\\nr=20\\nof merchant power as well as buyers, demonstrating that blackouts are not=\\n=20\\nlinked to market manipulation.\\n\\nBeyond theory, the idea would be difficult from a practical standpoint yet =\\nit=20\\nillustrates the growing frustration at many levels with the extraordinary=\\n=20\\nWestern power market. As the report\\'s authors conclude, by this summer, wit=\\nh=20\\nthe air conditioning off and California\\'s budget in tatters, \"a buyers\\'=20\\ncartel could look downright reasonable.\"=20\\n'"
